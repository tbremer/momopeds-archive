				Just remember to unscrew the pump from the engine and take out the guts before soldering over the openings.&nbsp; It&#39;s like a gear and a cylinder.&nbsp; And don&#39;t forget about the nipple on the intake or you&#39;ll have a nice big air leak.<br /><br />If you want to get fancy about the whole thing you can remove the whole pump and make a steel plate to go over the opening where it was.&nbsp; Oooooh.

				I&#39;d thought about that and was all, why not just use a metal plate? My neighbor is a mchinist and my other buddy is a metal worker, niiiice. Hey, if they can weld my kids crib then they can make a plate or two. BAM!<br /><br />I took out the little cylinder and the other piece, but one of those openings is MASSIVE, very hard to solder. hmmmm, waht to do what to do? I just need to plug it with something right?<br /><br />HOly fuck! I have my work cut out for me. My transmission oil filler plug snapped (the little loop on top). Is that supposed to screw out? cuz it ain&#39;t screwing out and the little loop/handle snapped off. SHIT!<br /><br />Also, Broke my clutch cable. It worked a couple of times, then wouldn&#39;t engage, then snap! Took it apart and tried pulling up by hand, ummmm nope.<br /><br />I think there&#39;s way more going on with this thing than I thought there would be.<br /><br />Cleaning the tank tomorrow with acid/alcohol/acid/water/alcohol etc... it&#39;s the bestest.<br /><br />Yeah, definitely need to figure out a way to get this monkey to fix it day. It&#39;s in great shape, the odo works and claims only 473 miles, but she&#39;s definitely been sitting for a long, long , long time.<br /><br />

				Filler plug is not threaded.&nbsp; We used a peice of ruber hose with a bolt through it as a plug.<br /><br />Mike was just telling me yesterday about how clutch cables break all the time for za50s.&nbsp; Also that they take a lot more force to engage than an e50 so you need the cable and cannot do it by hand.

				Okay, ghetto za50 clutch cable fix time.&nbsp; This has gotten me home multiple times.<br />Scenario A: Cutch cable breaks at the handlebars, but is still attached in the engine:<br />- It will be too short to use the cable in the normal clutch engagement hand lever.<br />- Turn your handlebars all the way to the right<br />- Wrap the broken cable tight around the right fork tube<br />- Hold the end with your hand, preferably gloved<br />- Turn the handlebar to your left while on the stand, and your clutch should engage<br />- Bam, your entire front end is now your clutch engagement system<br /><br />Scenario B: Clutch cable breaks at the engine side<br />- It will be too short to use the cable in the normal clutch engagement hand lever.<br />- You need to unscrew the smallest brass-colored nut with the hole in it from the engine side, but don&#39;t take the larger silver-colored nut out<br />- You need to tie knot in the end of the cable through that nut hole<br />- Screw that nut back in where it came from<br />- Turn your handlebars all the way to the right<br />- Wrap the broken cable tight around the right fork tube<br />- Hold the end with your hand, preferably gloved<br />- Turn the handlebar to your left while on the stand, and your clutch should engage<br />- Bam, your entire front end is now your clutch engagement system<br /><br />Now, those are emergency fixes to get you home, and a few rides beyond.&nbsp; Ideally you get a new clutch cable.&nbsp; All they are are open-ended throttle cables.&nbsp; Put the side with the nub on it through that holey nut, screw that in, put the open end through the clutch engagement handle and you&#39;re back to stock.&nbsp; Don&#39;t ever take that bigger silver long nut spacer thing out.&nbsp; It&#39;s a bitch to get back in.&nbsp; Just take the brass colored one out of the top of the silver colored one.&nbsp; You&#39;ll see it when you look.<br /><br />The oil filler screw is unneeded.&nbsp; Those are old, brittle, and broke on both of my za50s.&nbsp; All you need to do is fill the crankcase with oil through the small screw on the clutch side cover (side that says PUCH) until it dribbles out.&nbsp; I covered the top hole with gorilla tape to keep shit from getting in.<br /><br />ZA50s are a bitch, but you learn to live with them.

				Za50s have waaay more torque than the e50s.&nbsp; And supposedly the internal gearing in 2nd gear is better for top end than the e50s.&nbsp; Basically, idental setups on an e50 and za50 will have the za50 win everytime.<br /><br />Throttle cables work, but are thin.&nbsp; I would try cutting the big end off a brake cable and using the little end for the engine side of the clutch cable.<br /><br /><br />

				No problemo man.&nbsp; Did the clutch cable handlebar trick work?&nbsp; It&#39;ll get you riding.&nbsp; I rode for like a week that way once before I fixed it.<br /><br />If you can get a solid clutch cable all set, you&#39;ll be fine.&nbsp; Eventually the engine will start to not shift into 2nd gear unless you pull the clutch engagement lever and you&#39;ll notice it getting slower and slower.&nbsp; At that point you can either (cheapest option first): swap it for an e50, swap it for another za50, or have your za50 rebuilt.&nbsp; <br /><br />But for now, I&#39;d fix the clutch cable, fill er up with some ATF and ride it like you stole it.<br /><br />Oh, forgot to say...make sure to untie the cable from your forks, or everytime you turn left you&#39;re gonna get some ugly clutch engagement going on.&nbsp; haha&nbsp; And make sure that cable is tied up somewhere so it doesn&#39;t get caught in some chain/spokes/something nasty.<br /><br />That is all.

				Sweet.<br /><br />I&#39;m gonna need to figure out that carb gasket and banjo washer first. I can&#39;t find anything at Ace that fits.<br />Any ideas?<br /><br />Is the banjo washer metal or gasket material. I think I&#39;m gonna go to Autozone for gasket paper stuff.

				The banjo washer is gasket material.&nbsp; Just cutting one out would probably be easiest.&nbsp; Well, not easy, but better than waiting for one you overpaid for somewhere online.<br /><br />The float bowl gasket is a thicker gasket material too, but a big rubbe o-ring can work too.

				The o-ring is okay, it&#39;s the little gasket on the top of the carb.. I&#39;ll cut another, no biggie.<br /><br />Jesus! there was what lookked like drywall sediment, CHUNKS of it in the bottom of the tank. It&#39;s shiny and new-looking now though.<br /><br />I could make a living cleaning rusty tanks if there were enough of them out there and I really liked eating Ramen all day long.<br /><br />So, should I be looking at a high comp head then? and should it be a 50 or something for larger? Keeping in mind I&#39;ll be swapping for an e50 probably eventually and kitting (probably not for a long time, also, kits should have their own head anyways right?)<br /><br />And a Dellorto 19mm? That&#39;s kind of where I&#39;m heading with it. I won&#39;t get a pipe until I switch it out because I don&#39;t want to screw with cutting etc to make it fit. (looking at the Tecno Boss because it seems well-liked and is cheap enough to replace when it eventually eats itself.)

				Where is a good place to get a dellorto 19mm(or other sizes) anyway?&nbsp; Treats seems to have a pretty thin selection of carbs right now, at least on the dellorto side, anyway.&nbsp; I&#39;m planning on buying a 50cc cylinder and hi comp head and a proma gp or boss pipe in the very near future from benji and it would be nice to get a carb at the same time.&nbsp; I have a 14mm bing that I can use but I&#39;d like to upgrade everything at the same time.

				Am kidless for several hours today, so this will be my fixit day.<br /><br />Hey, just a tip. If you don&#39;t want to fuck with Puch fill plugs, then go to Walgreens and ask the pharmacist for a infant antibiotic syringe, the 5ml one, the nozzle fits PERFECTLY in the side screw. Takes many squirts, but there&#39;s no mess and no loss of precious ATF..ahaha

				I hate it when they look at you like you&#39;re nuts. One time I needed a brake cable, so I called a local motorcycle shop that was recommended to me. I asked if he had any universal brake cables and:<br />Me: Do you have any universal brake cables?<br />Him: What is it for?<br />Me: [stupidly, without thinking] A 1978 Puch Kromag<br />Him: [silence] [a small choked-back laugh] [incredulously] &lt;i&gt;Where&lt;/i&gt; do you think you&#39;re going to find a brake cable for &lt;b&gt;THAT&lt;/b&gt;?<br />Me: What? No, I don&#39;t need a Puch cable. I need a universal motorcycle brake cable. I had a Puch cable, and I cut it too short. I don&#39;t want to order a new one online, so I want to buy a universal one. <br />Him: But that won&#39;t work.<br />Me: Yes it will. I&#39;ll make it work. All I need is something longer than what I have now. <br />Him: [dubiously] Okay, well, come on by and I&#39;ll see what I&#39;ve got. <br /><br />He&#39;s actually a really nice guy, but I swear, I could FEEL him looking at me incredulously over the phone. These people just don&#39;t get the fact that it isn&#39;t usually about buying something that&#39;s supposed to work. It&#39;s about finding whatever is available and MAKING it work.

				Last time I was looking into this, I think the only place I could find them was at O&#39;Reilly. The only catch was that the compression tester was part of this huge kit of other tools you didn&#39;t need, and you had to borrow them as a set. There was some horrific deposit (several hundred dollars) to borrow the tools, but you got all the money back once you brought the tools back. I ended up just buying one from Harbor Freight for $10 or something, although if you have to ship it, I can&#39;t say I recommend that option. Their shipping is SLOOOOOOOOOOW.

				Are you having problems getting it started, or is it running like crap? The lack of air filter might have something to do with that. Do you choke it when you try to start it? That should cut down on some of the extraneous air flow and make it easier to start (if too much air is the problem, anyway). If it&#39;s running like crap, put some cloth over the air intake part of the carb, or use tape to cover up half(ish) of that hole. If it runs better, then you should upjet or get an air filter.

				You&#39;ve got just the stock Bing on it, right?<br /><br />(//i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff248/mycider/Moped/bingchoke.jpg)<br /><br />That little rod is attached to the choke plate inside the carb. When you push it down, it pushes the choke plate into the path of air movement. If you look down the hole in the back of your carb (where your air filter would usually be) you should be able to see the plate move up and down. When you twist the throttle, the choke plate will move up, un-choking the moped. If it starts choked and doesn&#39;t run well, you could try partially taping up or covering the hole I circled. Covering the hole somewhat might also help it start, but the choke should already be blocking most of that hole, so maybe not.<br /><br />You can kind of see the choke plate attached to the little push rod in this picture:<br /><br />(//i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff248/mycider/Moped/topofcarbsmaller.jpg)

				Hey, don&#39;t feel bad. My &quot;runs great, really clean, ready to ride, only 776 miles!&quot; Free Spirit had a chipped cylinder and a Yamaha piston. I kinda wish I&#39;d looked over it a little closer, but I also kind of doubt they would have been like, &quot;Yeah! Go for it!&quot; if I had asked to examine the cylinder. <br /><br />Until you get a choke plate, I&#39;d just use some tape or something and cover over part/most of that hole. If too much air is the problem, I&#39;d think that would at least get it started. The points thing is also a really good point though. You&#39;ll never know what the idiots who had the moped before you did to it, or removed, or otherwise screwed up unless you check everything yourself. For all you know, they pulled off the flywheel, saw the woodruff key and were all &quot;What&#39;s this? Oh, a mere piece of scrap metal! [throws in trash can]&quot; before they soldered in some points from a motorcycle and turned the stator plate upside down. (I think I might be a little bitter.)

				the woodruff key is a little D shaped piece of metal that goes into a slot on the crankshaft, and into a slot in the flywheel. See, on inside of the flywheel there&#39;s a lobe, the lobe opens the points,,, so the flywheel and the crankshaft need to be aligned so that happens at approximately TDC. &nbsp; The Stator, the plate that the points condensor,and induction coils are mounted to , is itself mounted on slotted holes , so that it can be rotated at little , one way and the other,,,that&#39;s your timing adjustment. &nbsp;retard and advance.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a strong spark, and its sparking at close to TDC, even without a carb, just a little spritz of gas should lite it up.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;compression can be an issue, but to start with, if you hold your finger over the spar plug hole, and feel anything,, you probably have enough compression to get it to run..<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; so take a little stick, and stick in the spark plug hole, and rotate the motor till thats at the very top...take a felt tip, and make a mark from the flywheel onto the motor...then with a flshlignt, look thru the slots, turn the motor in the direction ti runs,,,and watch for those points to just start to open,,,,you should be within a 1/4 inch on the flywheel.....post your results.

				Okay. Flywheel is removed, pictures are taken. I guess this goes a little more in-depth than the woodruff key, but hey, I&#39;ve got these pictures now, and I wanna use &#39;em. I apologize for the somewhat dubious picture quality. I was doing this in my car, and that&#39;s not the ideal environment for taking high quality photos. <br /><br />Step 1: Remove flywheel nut.<br /><br />(//i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff248/mycider/Moped/puchflywheelandnut.jpg)<br /><br />Step 2: Attach and utilize flywheel puller.<br /><br />(//i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff248/mycider/Moped/puchflywheelremoval.jpg)<br /><br />Step 3: Wohoo flywheel-less moped! You can kind of (not really) see the woodruff key in this picture. It&#39;s the dark rectangular patch on the crankshaft sort of by the condenser. <br /><br />(//i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff248/mycider/Moped/puchstatorplate.jpg)<br /><br />Here&#39;s a slightly better picture:<br /><br />(//i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff248/mycider/Moped/puchwoodruffkey.jpg)<br /><br />And here&#39;s a picture of the woodruff key all by itself:<br /><br />(//i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff248/mycider/Moped/puchwoodruffkey2.jpg)<br /><br />Basically, when the woodruff key is still on the flywheel, it&#39;s just slightly raised over the normal taper of the crankshaft. Then there&#39;s a notch in the inside hole of the flywheel like so:<br /><br />(//i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff248/mycider/Moped/puchwoodruffkeyslot.jpg)<br /><br />The raised part of the woodruff key fits into that slot. This makes sure that your flywheel lines up on on the crankshaft the same all the time. If you&#39;re missing the key, your flywheel could be in a totally wrong position. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Durr. I already forgot we were talking about a ZA50. Yeah, I&#39;ve got zero clue about those. I needed to take that flywheel off anyway though, so it&#39;s just as well :) There is some ZA50 timing stuff on pages 109-111 ish in the Puch service manual, but it&#39;s all the usual manual-version timing crap, with lots of special tools that nobody has or understands how to use or can afford (and by &quot;nobody&quot; I mean &quot;me&quot;). Someone here has gotta know about the woodruff key though.<br /><br />One time someone told me to find TDC this way by using a piston stop: Rotate the flywheel until the piston hits the piston stop. Make a mark on the flywheel. Rotate the flywheel the other way until the piston hits the piston stop again. Make another mark on the flywheel (both marks referenced to the same point on the case ... I think). Then measure between those two marks -- the halfway point should be TDC. If you don&#39;t have a piston stop, you can make one with an old spark plug and some nuts and bolts (like &lt;a href=&quot;//www.mopedarmy.com/forums/discuss/read.php?f=7&amp;i=75752&amp;t=75554&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; -- it&#39;s a timing tool, but if you get the right hardware on it, it works as a piston stop too). It is probably better to try and avoid removing the flywheel unless you have to take it off, but if you ever do want to remove it, you can just stuff some rope into the spark plug hole. That will block off part of your cylinder and stop the piston from moving, which will also keep your flywheel from turning so you can get the nut off. <br /><br />

Pretty gross and smelled like turpentine (there was oil dripping slowly from the litle hole in the baffle this whole time, I should have taken it off first.).<br /><br />Ran a cloth down both tubes and letting them sit and rain all over my garage floor last night and today.<br /><br />I tried starting just to see if I could get some fire and it popped just a couple of times, so I KNOW it works, I just have to get it back together and tinkered just right.<br /><br />Linda, the e50 pics you gave me are dead-on, so no worried about engien difference, even the shop manual tell you to refer to the e50 reassemble for that part. I get it now. I just didn&#39;t ndertand the point of the woodruff so where it was located was a mystery.<br /><br />Yeah, I didn&#39;t push the flywheel too much because I didn&#39;t want to get too deep without some hands-on fix-it help to save me just in case.<br /><br /><br />Mark, I did what you said and it&#39;s within an inch or so. Needs tweaking, but once I got it figured out it was late. I&#39;ll try again today using the guide you and bacon gave me. But it&#39;s CLOSE!<br /><br />Also, figured, I&#39;m draining shit, why not empty the transmission as well? So I did, and it wasn&#39;t pretty. instead of nice, clear red it was more of an opaque plum color, almost the same color as Plum baby food (love that stuff). So, re-plugged, re-filled, sloshed around, re-drained and it was ok. I thought maybe some moisture or water got in there, but who knows?&nbsp; I imagine I&#39;ll get it running like gangbusters and then my clutch will eat itself. The n I&#39;ll get to learn all about the other side of things.<br /><br />Perhaps I should get either another ZA50 or an e50 as a backup and rebuild that, then switch and rebuild while I use the other for a complete backup (doesn&#39;t everybody dream of a that?)<br /><br />Watched the timing an e50 video, yeah, that was pretty bad, but kind of a nice early primer, I&#39;ve learned mroe from youse guys.<br /><br />Tongiht the monster shall live!

				You can ask for the pull choke on any carb from treats, but you have to email him.&nbsp; As far as carbs are concerned, the hose mount is supposed to be better because the hose reduces vibrations to the carb, I don&#39;t think it makes a difference though.&nbsp; You won&#39;t go wrong with a Dellorto, once you learn how to tune it.

				Sorry dude, I misread. &nbsp;I thought you just said $100, not $100+. &nbsp;I can&#39;t read gud sumtimez.<br /><br />If you&#39;re doing the za50, you&#39;ll want to rebuilt it right. &nbsp;From everything I&#39;ve read it&#39;s not a transmission that you can just toss a few new things in and do the rest later. &nbsp;It&#39;s super precise (hence all the spacers in the rebuild kit), and finnicky to get right.<br /><br />I took my za50s off and replaced with e50s. &nbsp;But after riding Rick&#39;s kitted za50...it&#39;s so tempting to go back.

				Huh?&nbsp; Mine fits fine on a magnum with a MK65 on an e50.&nbsp; The only spot I had to do anything fancy was at the rear mount for it where I had to bolt a piece of plate steel to the exhaust mount on the frame to make it reach.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t have to mess with the header, nor did I have any kickstand issues though.<br /><br />FYI: No performance pipe ever bolts on directly.&nbsp; The rear mount is &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; at least a little off.&nbsp; Drilling new holes in the frame, hose clamps, metal extend-o bars, 11mm socket spacers, etc....all things I&#39;ve used to make them fit.&nbsp; haha<br /><br />On the MK65 I did paper against the case, then metal, then cylinder.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure how much it matters really.&nbsp; Oh, and I put permatex on all gasket surfaces except the exhaust gasket.&nbsp; I hate air leaks.

				The cable stop is just a tiny tiny two pronged fork sticking like 1/3&quot; off the side of the frame.&nbsp; You can get a bolt-on one from a kromag that goes through the engine mounts.&nbsp; Or you can weld one on.

				Last night I took off both stickers, and mounted the E50 and some other minor shit.<br /><br />Tonight, I removed the fenders, fucked with some wiring, mounted my regulator and my coil...ummm, hot hot will this coil get? I want to put it all where the old oil tank went, sort of right below the gas tank. If this is a bad idea, I&#39;ll change my plans. I don&#39;t want to blow myself up.<br /><br />So, can the coil go right below the gas tank?<br /><br />Got a flywheel nut from the za50.<br /><br />made a list of shit I need from the sto&#39;. woodruff, circlip tool, washers nuts and bolts, some hose if it satifies me. and a new kill switch.<br /><br /><br />Hmmm, worked the Sachs a little as well, tried to fix my throttle guide elbow, no luck.<br /><br />Gonna go buy some stuffs tomorrow.&nbsp; Hey, will any old kill switch type switch work as a kill switch? I&#39;m ditching the MASSIVE plastic ugly shits.<br /><br />Think I&#39;ll ditch the horn and see if I can add a musical one later, no fuckin&#39; joke, How rad would it be to have a General Lee horn under my seat? Or one that plays La Cucuracha?<br /><br />Soooo a coupla regalr open/shut swicthes for kill and lights will be ok.<br /><br />I&#39;m so close I can taste it.<br /><br />I like taking my time and getting it JUUUUST right.<br /><br />Oh, and figured out and mounted my Malossi air filter. Ok, these may not be a big deal, but it&#39;s enough and it&#39;s satisfying. let&#39;s face it, if I did it all in one day sure I&#39;d have a fucking great bike, but then I&#39;d have to buy something else to wrench on.

				Okay, there&#39;s good news and there&#39;s bad news. The good news is that I&#39;m fairly certain that the nut is M10 x 1.

It has plenty of M10 x 1.5 nuts, and it has one box of &quot;jam nuts&quot; (if I&#39;m remembering correctly) that were skinnier (which you&#39;d probably want anyway) that had M10 x 1.25 &quot;fine pitch&quot; nuts, but no M10 x 1 nuts, and hence, no nuts that actually fit on the crank.

				OOOOOOOK, NOW I&#39;m pissy cuz my custom-made shit doesn&#39;t just snap together like a model airplane!.<br /><br />Got my new sprocket from treats, got her on the E50, put on the circlip and guess what? There&#39;s TONS of play in the sprocket. There&#39;s GOTTA be something missing here.<br /><br />Charging my camera right now, but basically, my ZA fits it perfectly, but the E50, it goes right next to the case and thers\e&#39;s a space between the sprocket and the clip, so it wiggles. Is my E50 missing something? My ZA has this crown-shapes piece that spaces the sprocket away from the case. E50 doesn&#39;t.

				use a lock washer, or a flat washer and a jaggedy one.. you know, the jagged kind.<br /><br />Also! if all you need is to test that the motor fires, you don&#39;t need a sprocket, or if you want to hold on to my 14 tooth until the 16 tooth comes in.<br /><br />I&#39;d rather not lose the 16, but if it was the one step keeping you from running i&#39;d give it up.<br /><br />If you bring the 18 tooth, Mark might be willing to trade you?
