				I am going to be in St. Louis for a couple of days next week. I have never been there before. I am looking for suggestions on things to do while there. I am told that the Zoo is awesome, and there are attractions like the brewery but what else is there? Are there any places that a gear head like myself should be checking out if I have some free alone time?

				The zoo is awesome but there is some construction going on (sea lion/aquatic fun stuff) right in the middle so it is kind of annoying and you can&#39;t walk straight to some places but it is still full of some cool animals. Grant&#39;s farm is pretty cool too if you wanna see/touch/play with some farm animals. As far as other cool places, the city museum is fun. It&#39;s not really a museum, it is more of a huge interactive art piece with climbing and slides and shit. I&#39;m a fan of the Schlafly Tap Room and Schlafly Bottleworks too.

				Thank you for all the suggestions. We just got in town and into the hotel. I am looking forward to the City Museum and were going to the Bush Brewery of course. We stopped at the Pink Elephant on the way into town.

				Does one of the IRE members have a IRE logo flag in their window? I swear I saw one leaving the brewery to go to the city museum. I just caught a glimpse and was in a cab.
