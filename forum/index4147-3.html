				I&#39;ve had this bike for about 8 years now.&nbsp; The first four were spent shredding it around downtown.&nbsp; The last four were spent either in the corner or converted to electric.&nbsp; I think it is time to get it riding again.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I was messing around with parts tonight, and put a garelli tank on there, looks pretty good I think.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am thinking about either hiding batteries in there or taking a mold of the tank and fabbing up a replica.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.holmeshobbies.com/blog/<br />(http://www.holmeshobbies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/l_1600_1200_CF75A92D-0543-441E-B785-B8469B49B62E.jpeg)

				I&#39;m the only one in the states with this model, as far as the company knows.&nbsp; Maybe one or two around Seattle area, I wouldn&#39;t doubt.&nbsp; It is a stout fookin frame, when I originally built it with aluminum cranks it about ate my ankles up.&nbsp; I had to switch to steel cranks for some cush.&nbsp; <br /><br />This thing rides pretty gnarly, it is just like a motorbike should ride.&nbsp; The last motor I had on it put me right at 37mph on the flats.&nbsp;

				Got the motor and gearbox mounted, and drivetrain mostly finished. <br /><br />If this build doesn&#39;t rip I will either double the motor length (doubles torque and almost doubles peak and continuous power) or put a huge hub motor on it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Should be good for an easy 40mph, but the battery range is always the kicker.&nbsp; I may have enough batteries for about 20 miles at that speed, or 35 miles at 25mph.&nbsp; &nbsp;Really makes me want a hybrid so I can get that stealth running around town with gas for long distance.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or Maybe just two bikes that run at the same time...<br /><br /><br />I got some more work done on the electrics, encased the throttle control box (controller DSP) in epoxy for weather proofing and got the motor speed controller in.&nbsp; &nbsp;The controller will tuck behind the seat post tube under the gussets.&nbsp; <br /><br />Need to make a few battery boxes and tidy up the wiring next.&nbsp; Rear brakes would be nice too.

				Won&#39;t an integrated motor/swingarm system give you a much greater unsprung weight which would make riding rough and skittish at the rear when hitting little bumps in the road, especially in a turn?

				Only if the motor is closer to the tire than the pivot.&nbsp; The other option of mounting motor on frame gets into anti squat, and that is a huge beast to deal with on a bicycle conversion. <br /><br />I haven&#39;t drawn up the new rear end, but the motor should be within 6&quot; of the pivot, and about 16&quot; from the axle.&nbsp; So most of the weight will act sprung.&nbsp;

				OIC.&nbsp; I had the idea that the integrated motor/pivot arm would hav the motor about evenly divided between the pivot and the axle where, for all practical purposes it was all unsprung weight.

				Of course &quot;all&quot; wasn&#39;t the best choice of words . . . a &quot;signifacant amout&quot; would have been more accurate.&nbsp; It wouldn&#39;t be all unsprung unless the engine was located out on the axle, such as a hub engine, as in many electric vehicles where the unsprung weight of the heavy electric motors does cause a significant amount of skittish handling and rough riding on uneven road surfaces.

				So I got this thing running!&nbsp; The STL boys saw it run briefly before I had to leave, and it still needed some driveline tweaking.&nbsp; I went down to GA with nothing but time and parts and got it running solid!&nbsp; Until I really cranked up the power, that is.&nbsp; &nbsp;This thing runs like a raped ape, just ballistic acceleration for such a light vehicle.&nbsp; I really need to tone down the throttle response, it is a bit too jumpy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Put some hard throttle on it after running it a bit, and the set screw walked around the shaft and dug a nice trench into the jackshaft.&nbsp; Of course the shavings got buried under the gears and galled the sprockets to the shaft.&nbsp; Gotta find my gear puller to get this sorted out.&nbsp; Maybe a flat spot is a good idea on this thing.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />So this isn&#39;t the most stealth electric moped because of the gearbox noise, but this is certainly the most powerful one I have ridden.&nbsp; Under even &quot;light&quot; throttle I was hitting 5hp peaks.&nbsp; I am told this motor will burst output in excess of 9hp with the right gearing.&nbsp; Not bad for a 32oz motor.&nbsp; I also have a double stack on the way, twice the motor power of the one I currently have.&nbsp;

				With the help of a MMP gear puller and some sweat, I got the gearbox sorted back out.&nbsp; 19 degree air on the face at 30mph ain&#39;t no joke.&nbsp; <br /><br />Range test this weekend, plus some work to conceal the batteries possibly.&nbsp; I am hoping for 7 miles from my 10ah 44v pack.&nbsp; The wheel - motor setup got right at 10 miles.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Vid of some low speed action&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhMipqh-04

				Took it for a short ride yesterday and blew up the power side freewheel.&nbsp; It spit bearings out all over the place and then the chain fell off and locked up the rear wheel. <br /><br /><br />Oh well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Time for some more work.&nbsp;

				Looks like I may have a solid ride!&nbsp; The only problem is that it is a power hog.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if the bearings need to seat or what, but it takes almost a horsepower to just push the gears.&nbsp; I get about 4 miles on the pack that used to get me 10 miles, at about the same speed. <br /><br /><br />But what power!&nbsp; With such a relatively light front end it was trying to pop wheelies on me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Top speed is right about 30 with the current gearing.&nbsp; I do have another set of batteries that will increase my range to 10 miles.&nbsp; Nowhere near what I want or could get with another setup, but this is a learning experience for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Rode around exactly 10 miles today.&nbsp; Once I pull off the data I will know how long a charge will last me.&nbsp; I was having more issues with the driveline wandering around.&nbsp; I am about ready to lose an extra stage of reduction or go back to a hub motor so I don&#39;t have to deal with it.&nbsp; Although the system has one helluva power to weight advantage over wheel motors, if it is always messing up it doesn&#39;t do me much good as a dependable vehicle.

				Here is how she sits right now.&nbsp; I do like it with the 17&quot; front wheel, although it is built a bit too heavy I think.&nbsp; I could have used spokes a size or two smaller with great results.&nbsp; &nbsp;The high battery pack really handles well, surprisingly so much better that I can&#39;t switch back.&nbsp; I will not be running packs in the frame unless I double the capacity.&nbsp; &nbsp;The plan is to mount the battery box at two points on the frame, and on the seat.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a nice black leather spring saddle on the way.&nbsp; <br /><br />(http://www.holmeshobbies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/top-tank.jpg)<br /><br /><br />Here is the initial plug.&nbsp; I may bondo the sides, or just sand down a bit more.&nbsp; The shape is a bit larger than it needs to be, so I will probably round off the front and make some divots in the &quot;tank&quot; for knee grips.&nbsp; &nbsp; Very boxy, I want to improve the aero of it.&nbsp; &nbsp;The blue foam sands much better than I anticipated.&nbsp; <br />(http://www.holmeshobbies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/tank-plug.jpg)

				I went ahead and laced up some MTB wheels for the task.&nbsp; &nbsp;Changed motors too.&nbsp; This dropped the weight from 74lbs down to 59lbs.&nbsp; <br /><br />(http://www.holmeshobbies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/wpid-IMAG0233.jpg)<br /><br /><br />Here is a vid of how it runs compared to other bikes.&nbsp; The only 50cc bike that has me at speed is RK&#39;s.&nbsp; I bet he is creeping up on 50 on 50 with that bike.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://youtu.be/jAFP0r-ACAk
