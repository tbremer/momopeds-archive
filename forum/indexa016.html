				this is were we all work on peds and hang out. It is a work in progress. The yellow pa50 and grande are mine. The rest are projects that are getting completed (someday). The motorized bike is my buddy sams, he lives in a upstairs apartment and wanted a ped. We came to the conclusion that the easy to carry bike was up his alley.

				I started out with a qt50. There will always be a place in the shop for a noped. OR when you come down you should bring a ped and get in contacted with me. I normally have a loaner, but they are all dropping like flies since the pa50 came into the shop.

				Ok then let me clarify, I dont like the yamaha or suzuki nopeds. That shit is ugly.<br /><br />I think I can probably pack up on of my peds and ride around a little bit, it sucks though cause its my friends 21st b-day on the 21st.... so I kinda have to party with her. We shall see how that all turns out, maybe I could ride on Sunday morning or afternoon or something. I dont like to take peoples loaners. I always have to fix them before I ride them ha ha.. maybe not yours but I&#39;ve had to do it in the past. I would rather ride my peds anyways.

				I will have to talk to my friend about the Honda 110. He loves it but wants parts for his magnum. He mention it was for sale to Matt of comosc when we all rode this weakend. He told Matt to make an offer. &nbsp;I am sure the offer stands for anyone. Keep in mind it has a good title and is a 110.

				What&#39;s up everybody, just signed up.&nbsp; Thought I&#39;d chime in since the 110 is mine.&nbsp; Like RK said, I&#39;m open to offers if people are interested but I&#39;m in no hurry.&nbsp; Also true that I&#39;m more interested in upgrading my Magnum XK right now than messing with the Honda trail.&nbsp; So, I would also be interested in trades for E50 performance parts.&nbsp; I need everything, totally stock so far.&nbsp; &nbsp; -b

				<em><strong>A cool one!</strong></em> &lt;kidding&gt;<br />No it&#39;s a power bike I&#39;ve dubbed the <strong>&quot;Low-Ped&quot;</strong>. The first MidMo-Peds custom to wobble out of the shop ;-)<br /><br />I found the base bike (Schwinn O.C.C. Stingray) at a local pawn shop just after Christmas for $60. Just sitting there begging for an engine so, I ordered the engine kit (80cc) from bike-berry.<br /><br />Then a lot of help from Ryan &amp; Jay in the fabrication &amp; assembly, some trial and error with the finishing touches still to come; Lights!, Matching brake and clutch levers, front fender etc.. I&#39;ll end up with about $300.00 in total. Can&#39;t beat that for one unique little monster.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />
