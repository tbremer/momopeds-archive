				I hate it when I&#39;m checking out CL or whatever and somebody is like &quot;over 1000 invested&quot; or &quot;staggering amounts of money invested&quot;. It&#39;s just such bullshit because it&#39;s not like your moped is any kind of investment. You buy it, throw a shitton of money into it and then turn around and sell it for like $50 more than you spent when you bought it. What&#39;s worse is when you call the fuckers and they&#39;re all about &quot;Well, I&#39;ve invested a lot of time into this bike.&quot; WTF does that mean? I&#39;ve never invested time into any 2 wheeled vehicle, but I&#39;ve sure wasted a lot of time drinking and spinning a wrench. I think some fools need schooled on the difference between &quot;invest&quot; and &quot;squander&quot;. Because I&#39;ve got a bunch of busted ass rusted shit in my garage they can invest in.

				I don&#39;t know man. I have definetly &quot;invested&quot; time into 2 of my frames (freespirit &amp; maxi-n). I&#39;ve also squandered many an hour (all of my Batavus, a35 topends, porting some cylinders into bricks). I think its really a matter of getting a bike road ready vs making it into something completely different. And if the work put in actually increased the rideability, safety, &amp; performance.<br /><br />

				I don&#39;t know, man. I&#39;ve spent a lot of hours improving my bike. The bike will be worth more when I&#39;m done than it was when I bought it, so that IS an investment, isn&#39;t it?<br /><br />Some people just don&#39;t understand that THEIR time is more valuable to THEM than it is to anyone else...<br /><br />Then again, there&#39;s a reason why some art is worth WAY fucking more than the actual paint an canvas that it&#39;s painted on.<br /><br />Mopeds are like art in that way, and to some, many of us I think, they ARE art.

				&lt;i&gt;I&#39;ve never invested time into any 2 wheeled vehicle, but I&#39;ve sure wasted a lot of time drinking and spinning a wrench.&lt;/i&gt;<br /><br />^^This is perfect. <br /><br />I mean, I do think that you can &quot;invest&quot; in a vehicle, but you have to do things that actually make it better and worth more, and you can&#39;t spend $1000 doing investments that only make it worth an extra $300. If you fail to do either of those things, then your personal failure to understand the concept of an &quot;investment&quot; does not make it okay for you to ask 3x what the vehicle is worth.

				not unlike &quot;it ran earlier&quot; being a moped saying I.R.E.<br />&nbsp; when I visit scooter and motorcycle shops,, and the subject of peds comes up, always i hear &quot;you can&#39;t make any money on mopeds&quot;,,, and the list of reason is extensive,,,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Y.C.M.A.M.on M.&nbsp; &nbsp;, needs some work

				Lindar said it better, but yeah, that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about. Somebody throws waaay more cash into something than they&#39;ll ever get out of it and then get all offended when you tell them as much.

				I see this a lot in the classic car community.&nbsp; It is a little easier to justify, but all-in-all unless it&#39;s a garage queen, it is not an investment, it&#39;s transportation.&nbsp;

				I was going to say that, but the thought of the &quot;it&#39;s not a toy, it&#39;s my ride&quot; folks giving me a beat-down was not very appealing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would point out that a well-maintained car can save your life and limb, but the mopeds tend to do the exact opposite.&nbsp; <br /><br />When riding my Bravo about the neighborhood, I get questions from folks on where I got it, and why don&#39;t I start fixing them up and selling them.&nbsp; Which might be an option if I ever found one that didn&#39;t end up costing me around $300.00 by the time I&#39;ve replaced all the missing parts...&nbsp; <br /><br />Mind you I have a decent job, but I can&#39;t fathom spending more than $300.00 on a good condition bike.&nbsp; Just look at those three Vespa models for sale up in Michigan on eBay.&nbsp; $700.00 each and not a one has been sold after being up for over a month.&nbsp; These things just aren&#39;t worth that much.&nbsp;
