				Hey guys, there are only a few more weeks till MLC. I urge you guys to fix up the loose strings and whatnot that your peds have. I would prefer that we not have breakages due to people being cheap/skeet on parts. If ya gotta order something, do it now.. fix your peds up right so we can all just cruise. <br /><br />Now that I&#39;ve said this.. I&#39;ll be the one stuck on the side of the road. Maybe I should bring more than 1 ped... nah, I&#39;ll just make sure I&#39;m all fixed up and ready to ride.<br /><br />I&#39;m buying lots of jets today... hellz yeah

				last year we took 3 spare peds in the break down truck,,,at the end of the mountain climb, there were 5 broke peds in the truck... I think the tally went<br />&nbsp;Bangers, rubbed a tire hot, burned a puch piston and finished on a ciao<br />&nbsp; My Flandria&#39;s carb clogged<br />&nbsp;Mattso clogged a bing,,and rode another puch in<br />&nbsp; Annie seized her swinger<br />&nbsp; Shaner clogged his hobbit carb, and finished on a seabring<br />&nbsp; Jabulani had a flat.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess the mountain just got stuff mudddy

				That&#39;s a good question! Because, it could have been a flaw in building the engine (Mike or Annie), It could caused by weird mixture (who knows), bad electrical (me), an airleak in exhaust or intake, or funny riding skillz.<br /><br />:/ I&#39;m distraught

				wow kevin...its a moped rally do you really expect no broken peds? Lighten up...right now as i type this there are 15 cop cars, a chopper,&nbsp; &nbsp;2 news teams, a guyon the ground and shit ton of cops in front of my house! What that has to do with broken peds...i don&#39;t know i just thought i mention it.&nbsp; I do know that the guy ran his car into a pole and that stopped him....then a cop pulled a 1 year old kid out of the car.&nbsp; The great thing is that the guy driving had a car seat in the trunk. argh...man kind...THIS IS why i cheer for the aliens when attacking the planet.

				I saw a dude at lunch fly thru 39th and main. Thats when I saw the copter. I guess maybe it ended by your place, but he was going towards state line direction. I didnt bother to chase as I dont like cops or robbers. The guy was driving a black lincoln or t bird.. 2 door 90&#39;s model. Shit maybe I should become a cop with my awsome detective work via moped stl and chuck my right hand go to girl for late breaking news.<br /><br />Yes I expect my peds to be in tip top shape, is it really asking too much for everyone elses to be too? :)

				hear hear. maybe if you do a full rebuild and put the bike back to stock with 100% NOS parts (harry hoppe!), then you could make a really reliable (for a long, long time) moped.<br /><br />But whats the fun in that?

				No, you just need to do routine maintinence and fix shit the right way. Half of the people I know zip tie, ghetto rig, duct tape... and you know what part of the ped fails... not the crank.. not the carb.. the jank shit is what breaks. Plus if you havent greased, or dont know if anyone has greased the bearings on your ride.. maybe you should take this time to do that too. Now if you build a nice kitted e50 and it siezes... then thats all on you, not the ped. <br /><br />I mean everyone ghetto rigs, including myself. However I dont plan on taking a ghetto bike on a 40+ mile ride. Leave your jankness for the mile trip to the grocery store or something. There is a time and place for everything. The time Missouri has company, should not be the time you show off how much duct tape you used on your last build. We shouldnt procreate the hoosier personality that people think all Missourians have. Make you ped look nice. I&#39;m definitly bringing stuff to show off to the out of state people. All I need to do is put the pedals back on, and wire up the ped like its supposed to be.. I might even bring the Si just b/c its soo minty and variators kill DIRT hills

				I&#39;m all about the ride chuck, not all about the breakdowns. I watched so many people break down on rides while on my adventures. I think I was the only person helping any of them. I dont mind hanging and waiting for someone but I feel no remorse for people who purposely crackhead-ify their peds and then cant figure out whats wrong or how to fix them. Plus I feel the need to talk shit.. maybe Linda is right the moped godz will spite me.. I like to tempt... if I dont break down then I can talk more shit, right?

				Let&#39;s vote: Who is never going to let Kevin forget it if his mopeds break?<br /><br />*raises hand*<br /><br />For the most part, I do agree. If you know you&#39;re going to be riding long distances in a city that&#39;s not KC, it&#39;s probably not the time to bring your most untrusted POS bike. We should all try to fix as much as we can before we go (and that applies to you, Mr. No-Lights Wiring Mess). However, no matter how much any of us do, someone is almost certainly guaranteed to break down. When that happens, we are going to stop, and wait, and help, and not get all pissy whiny-faced about waiting, because (1) that is what we would want others to do for us if the situation were reversed and because (2) mopedders stick together. We don&#39;t know who the moped breakdown monster is going to strike next; it could be you, it could be me, it could be any of us. There&#39;s no sense in getting on each other&#39;s cases about breakdowns that haven&#39;t even happened yet. I think that Missouri hospitality will more than make up for any ghetto shit you people put on your mopeds (and if it doesn&#39;t, I don&#39;t really care, since I&#39;m from Kansas), and how you treat someone will make much more of an impression on them than how nice or fast or whatever your moped is.

				I&#39;ll work on the wires Linda, I actually hope I break down if Chuck is gonna have some wiskey. <br /><br />I&#39;ll walk if my shit breaks down... its faster than amf :)<br /><br />I also think it would be hilarious if my shit breaks down cause I&#39;m probably gonna be held responsible for Scotts ped too. We got the parts, just need the work... hopefully its nice enough to work on peds but not nice enough to ride them.<br /><br />Bought a yeller maxi today.. Aarons old one chuck.
