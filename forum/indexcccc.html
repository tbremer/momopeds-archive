			Clean the carb and check the reed bock under it.&nbsp; Take the pipe off, dump all the oil out of it and BBQ it.

			Reeds wont fart will 25-28, not that. Carb may need an air filter. Id start by examining the exhaust port off your jug, bought 1 of these once that did 10 miles an hour, the exhaust port was so clogged it was the size of a straw. After cleaning the carbon from it, did 28mph.&nbsp; Could also check your throttle cable and make sure it is opening the carb all the way. If non of that works, Id buy it off you for 150$.

			Thanks for all the info... did a complete cleaning of the carb and it still only gets 12mph... another fella told me to BBQ it... now I need a barrell... the idea of using a BBQ seems as though this will do the same thing... ;) ;) ;) It sounds as though I have a Plan... ;) ;) ;)
