			There hasn&#39;t been a post in the KC board for 93 days.&nbsp; Just thought I would break the streak.&nbsp; Plus, you midwesterners should try to rally the troops for a trip to Portland and come to UB&#39;s Zwicklemania 5.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cool, see you there.

			Shhhh. Im trying to convince Jake that he wants to drive us to Portland for the ub rally. We&#39;ll see. Ps. You forgot to get your moped white elephant shit from Kevin&#39;s before you left, dummy. Might be a good enough excuse to make the drive

			Naw. Not anymore. Of course there&#39;s Kevin and Brett here, but there&#39;s a cluster of us old skate buddies that got into mopes apparently right as soon as the KC scene was dying out. Just been riding, wrenching, learning, and slowly expanding.
