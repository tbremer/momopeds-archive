				I stay out of the middle of the pack...well out of the pack all together. I&#39;ve been to many a moped rally...you dont want to get close to anyone, period. I prefer to ride alone so I can break the law. I&#39;m not really worried about cars, if you go faster than the people in cars you are usually pretty safe. But other moped riders scare me. I just get out my video camera and hope that someone does something that I should record. The real problem is that no 2 people have the same speed moped, that in itself creats chaos. If only people would drive like cars, single file unless you want to pass, which can become an issue on a 2 lane road. No real solution besides having the road all to yourself. I mean doesnt everyone wish they had nothing but road infront of them?

				You can have all the rules you want as a rider, but the reality is that there just aren&#39;t any.&nbsp; It&#39;s a swarm, not a formation.&nbsp; Pick a line, stick to it.&nbsp; Don&#39;t change your line without looking EVERYWHERE around you because while you&#39;re moving to the left at 34mph to pass someone doing 28mph, someone else is blasting by at 50mph.&nbsp; You don&#39;t want to move into their path.

				When I ride in a group or at a rally I try to spot the noobs and stay away from them. In-experienced riders, or riders that are not used to riding in packs are usually the ones that cause the most problems. Like that kid in the KC rally that was too busy waving to the camera and took Shaner out.<br />And like Mike said pick a line, use your mirrors and look over your shoulder before changing lanes. <br />That Guide To Group Riding is good to make the new comers read before they ride with you. I am going to print a bunch of those out if anyone wants one let me know.

				I know I&#39;m going to get a lot of flak for this, but...<br />link --&gt; Here are some very good guidelines for safe group riding. <br />&nbsp;(http://www.stlscooterforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=507)<br /><br />That&#39;s how I ride, when I&#39;m not riding w/ moped kids, or by myself. In the scooter (and motorcycle!) world, safety is top priority while group riding. Proper group riding with safety in mind just is not a moped tradition. I&#39;ve got some ideas, but no good reasons why.

				there is only one rule to pack riding: don&#39;t EVER change your path. <br /><br />This only applies to slow bikes or newbs, otherwise your job is to get as close as possible to everyone without actually touching them. Fingers in buttcracks earn brownie points (get it?), and grabbing people&#39;s brake levers or throttles always makes for fun times.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, avoid the pack. Build a fast bike and learn to ride it, and never deal with the stupid people who can&#39;t ride their bike without a 10 foot radius safety bubble. Moped packs are stupidly dangerous, so you always need to have a safe escape route or a plan, and more so you need faith the people around you aren&#39;t idiots who bail left or right in a pack of 50 people when they seize. So yea, go fast, its safer that way.
