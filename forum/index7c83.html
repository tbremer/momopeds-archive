				Awesome people - Denver and KC riders kick ass<br /><br />Awesome rides - 53? bikes went all over KC<br /><br />No breakdowns except for the jankity &quot;spare&quot; peds we brought.&nbsp; They were more like glorified parts bikes.<br /><br />Lots of people were ooh-ing and aah-ing over the old bikes we brought, and my magnum (of course).<br /><br />Mark got a new moped, putting his total number of mopeds up to 4382<br /><br />Mark revealed that he has a stinky shoe fetish.<br /><br />Cookie shots - Explanatory video will be up soon<br /><br />Pics from me and Annie will go up tonight.&nbsp; I&#39;ll post a link here when we get them posted somewheres.

				it&#39;s cool! I wasn&#39;t upset, just thought I should explain myself a little more. But, yes, what mark said, we need stock garelli NOI exhausts. They have to be NOI--the garelli has two different engines, one is horizontal (NOI) and the other is vertical (VIP), we need the horizontal.<br /><br />Of course, there&#39;s the possibility that our perception of italy as a place with italian moped parts falling from the sky might be wrong...I guess we&#39;ll forgive you if you can&#39;t find any.
