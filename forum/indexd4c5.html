				gotcha, yeahm its mini-dv, i&#39;ll throw it on the charger tonight and get it ready. i&#39;ll draw up a mount idea, just a piece of bent steel the can be bolted to the helmet and have a spot for a mount screw come up from the bottom. universal mount for a camera. as well as a safety cable as a backup if the mount comes off. you said it doesnt have foam? anyone got some extra to cut up? <br /><br />everyone knows: vibrations = loose, loose = broken camera = sadface

				metal unicorn spike is a no.. maybe $200 camera vs my head.. yeah.. <br /><br />im thinking a mounted plate with an L bend coming off the side, mounted on the ear portion, no long bolts, no major cutting through good foam, and having a counterweight on the other side if needed, gives a nice view if done right and leaving it around head level when stopped so it can be right there for people to be viewed on the level instead of the &quot;giant looking down on all&quot; look
