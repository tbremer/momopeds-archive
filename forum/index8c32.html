				I&#39;m gonna build a little foundry one day.&nbsp; Maybe a two year goal, after a complete a full moped frame this year.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />With lots of time and effort, we can make absolutely anything we want.&nbsp; &nbsp;It just seems that society has allowed our generation to forget.

				//www.refwest.com/<br />//refwest.com/kastolite30liplus.aspx<br /><br />Good resource for refractory to make a foundry oven. Refractory is what furnace and kiln bodies are made of.&nbsp;

				I started a little foundry. I took an old smoker and flipped it upsidedown. I welded a 3&#39;&#39; pipe to a slotted brake disc and set that inside a cut down 5 gallon bucket for the inner chamber. I made a huge batch of this mixture of refractory: //www.backyardmetalcasting.com/refractories.html and cast it around the 5 gallon bucket inside the smoker. Then let it cure, knocked the 3&#39;&#39; pipe/ brake disc back through, and cut the bucket out. It is real low buck. I was going to fire it with hard wood charcoal. Somehow I haven&#39;t ever tried it out yet.

				I finally got around to messing around with that forge/foundry. It will melt aluminum really easily. It has been forever since I have done any sandcasting, but we did manage to obtain a 100lb anvil etc. Made some crude knives out of railroad spikes.<br /><br />(//farm8.staticflickr.com/7021/6763956909_cfea23c35b.jpg) (//www.flickr.com/photos/75203809@N07/6763956909/)
