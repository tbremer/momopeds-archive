				I have a few stickers I could scan for you, but I don&#39;t think the quality would end up being that great. I&#39;m sure Chuck or someone has a good copy though.

				I think yelling is the best option, yes.<br /><br />Linda - I am going to be making the logo really tiny, so if you want to scan one in and don&#39;t mind that would be cool!

				Call chuck if you want to get ahold of her, she told me she doesnt get on the web very often and the best way for us to stay in touch is via phones... kinda the opposite of the spokesmen who use MA as a bulliten board

				Thanks Linda. <br /><br />You&#39;re fine Chuck, I know what it&#39;s like to be too busy to breathe!<br /><br />So, will your new job allow you to bring 27 cartons of smokes again? If not, I don&#39;t know if we can still be friends...
