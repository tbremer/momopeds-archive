				yeah, it stinks, but osha is the bare MINIMUM requirements. what stinks worse is when you work for somebody that makes you do more safety shit than required by law.<br />scroll down on that spray booth shit and look at the dangerous shit, like sparks and ventilation. we can do that. any dust laying around higher than a dime is a risk, if the conditions are all there.<br /><br /><br />today i learned about dust. pretty much all the dust in walters is combustible. aluminum, plastic, silica, metal, etc. steel wool is flammable along with everything on that shelf<br />anything organic<br />all an explosion needs from dust is<br />1 oxygen<br />2 fuel<br />3 ignition<br />4 dispersement<br />5 confinement<br /><br />hazzards x assume probability = willingness to accept risk<br /><br />pics from a dust explosion<br />one was from flour, the other was from acoustic ceiling tiles<br /><br />i think we should light some dust on fire outside to see what happens<br />

				Dust explosions are mean...<br /><br />Get some sawdust in a 55gal drum and it&#39;ll shoot a fireball into the sky if you add a fan(disbursement) and a match(ignition).<br />Fun if there are no trees or wood structures around.<br /><br />Every time OSHA pisses me off I remember the couple of times it has kept me from doing something REALLY stupid...then I don&#39;t feel so bad. but yeah, still a huge pain in the ass

				Back when my little bro was in HS, while the teacher was out, he and a buddy were in shop tossing firecrackers at each other.&nbsp; The teacher came back just as my brother threw one that bounced and went into the sawdust collection system, blowing out the whole wall on that end of the building.<br /><br />Little bro finished at a different school.

				Wasn&#39;t there a big problem with grain silos exploding around the 70&#39;s because of lack of ventalation to remove the grain dust?
