				Yo,<br />OK I know I mentioned it a few times, but just to be clear,&nbsp; I am having 60 shirts made for the IRE way!<br /><br />They will be here in a week, they have been designed by me and my world renowned Clown/artiste BFF, Dug-less.<br /><br />They will be bitch and you will want more than one, I picked out some killer colors... Limited run on MAGENTA! WE will have MINT, or oh we have baby blue, baby yellow and of course we have the standard white.<br /><br />I ordered some&nbsp; Xtra (tittie showing off) SMALL, for TOM, Jon,..etc and a few XTRA BIG GULP size for Rickems,&nbsp; Myke etc...<br /><br />The bulk are Medium and Large, the final artwork looks so good Im not going to post it, Im gonna wait until the shirts arrive, for that &#39;Pop&#39; effect.<br /><br />Please feel free to buy as many as you like as I overspent and now Tracy and I are eating SPAM and Oatmeal until I get our money back....<br /><br />Ultra cheap price of $10 a shirt!<br /><br />Reserve yours now!<br />
