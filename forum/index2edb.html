				So Katie was driving her car down 55 the other day, dude driving a fucking dump truck tried to merge into her lane, banging up the side of her car. Dude then tried to drive off, Katie followed him, called the cops and eventually got his info. <br /><br />We just looked the guy up on Casenet, convicted of murder and burglary, so he knows how to break into houses AND kill people on purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Oh yeah, forgot to mention that the guy also has OUR address too. He was being really dodgy about being in the accident and flat out denied it. So his insurance company is investigating him now. Of course we found out he murdered a person AFTER we filed the insurance claim. DAMN!

				Just was involved in a hit and run on 70 today.&nbsp; We tried to follow her but lost her, then just so happened to get off at the same exit.&nbsp; She then saw us and drove like a maniac to get away and almost caused more accidents in the process.&nbsp; Car had temp tags with no license plate. Black Durango.&nbsp; Fucking bitch probably didn&#39;t have insurance.&nbsp; What the fuck is wrong with people?
