				Nope, black is plain. I&#39;ll make you a black on black t-shirt... you&#39;ll be super mysterious with your hidden black message.<br /><br />Photobucket is down now, so you&#39;ll have to wait to see the coolness.

				So more people want black or darker colors? I&#39;m going to be making a lot more of them this evening. I&#39;d like to find out what people want so I dont go wasting my time making purple shirts that say &quot;BARNEY&quot; on them.<br /><br />I&#39;m planning on bringing like 30 of these to MLC. If no one wants them, then I&#39;ll take them to LA and let Missouri be known. I will also work as a trader, taking some IRE stuff to LA in hopes of brining back a few crazy cool shirts on trade. <br /><br />My plan is to sell these for 5 bucks... does that seem reasonable? I&#39;ll even give them a hug before and after I print them, so you know they are made with love.

				Kevin, selling these shirts is a bad Idea. These shirts need to be given away, especially to IRE. Remember when the spokesmen came to KC? were they selling their shirts? NO! it&#39;s a gift to the rally throw-er from the throw-ee<br /><br />I&#39;m sure we can pitch in as a group to cover the costs of productions if that&#39;s what you&#39;re worried about.

				I&#39;ll save you a shirt Jimmy.<br /><br />I got shirts for Matt and Chuck. Matt already gave me money for the cotter pins and your shirts... thanks matt.<br /><br />I&#39;ve put about 100 bucks into the production cost... and at least 2-3 bucks per shirt. I&#39;d like to give them away but I cant justify doing that unless I get something in exchange... other shirts are my preference. I know selling them is a dick move, but I cant justify spending 100 bucks+t-shirt cost+time. I dont so much mind the time or the 100 dollar investment(screen/paint/supplies), but the shirts arent free.. and apperently trying to find plain shirts isnt the easiest thing to do for cheap. Especially black... dont know why. <br /><br />But I&#39;m still down for trades...I&#39;d prefer trades as stated before. <br /><br />Check them out..I think tonight we did even better. How about I give away the BM shirts, but if you want puch shirts you gotta give me puch stuffz.<br />http://i450.photobucket.com/albums/qq225/OrangeRobin/Ahh%20shirts/PICT0526.jpg<br />http://i450.photobucket.com/albums/qq225/OrangeRobin/Ahh%20shirts/PICT0529.jpg<br />http://i450.photobucket.com/albums/qq225/OrangeRobin/Ahh%20shirts/PICT0533.jpg<br />http://i450.photobucket.com/albums/qq225/OrangeRobin/Ahh%20shirts/PICT0535.jpg<br /><br />I didnt hug these..

				that grey one with red black and yellow is dope! What size is it? if it&#39;s medium or small i dibs it!.<br /><br />Oh, and like I said before, i&#39;m willing to chip in for the cost of production. maybe a case of beer for your time too.

				I like where Mike is going with this one. I think its a large Mike. I had a hard time finding smaller shirts. It will probably work well on you though. I&#39;ll save it for ya. I knew someone would like it. <br /><br />Bangers gets the one that is sleeveless that says &quot;Spank me&quot; on it, with a logo under it.<br /><br />I&#39;d love beer trades.. I forgot to mention that. Or those tiny bottles of wiskey or vodka or whatever. Those little things are soooo cute.<br /><br />The production costs, I&#39;ll take the hit on that b/c now I can have my own clothing line. Plus its not like 100 bucks goes into each shirt, just like maybe a buck or 2 for the paint and a few bucks for a shirt. Actually making the design on the screen is the most time consuming. Thats where beer or drinks come in.<br /><br />If any of you want specific shit, bring me your clothes... hopefully not the ones you are wearing, but bring me some blank shirts in whatever size you want. I&#39;ll print them up before next weekend. You could probably even leave them at chucks and I can pick them up on Sunday night, if no body sticks around later. <br /><br />This is definitely taking time out of my &quot;help scott get a running ped schedule&quot;...we need to work on that tonight and most of next week. <br /><br />Supposed to be Sunny and nice for MLC

				Yeah, it would be better if we could give the Breakfast Mafia shirts away. It builds goodwill with other people. They&#39;ll be all like, &quot;Look at this dope Breakfast Mafia shirt that the Breakfast Mafia gave me! Man, those guys are so cool!&quot; I&#39;m definitely down to throw in some money or baked goods or something to offset production costs/time, and I was planning on bringing you shirts to print for me. Also, if for some reason you run out of paint or shirts or whatever, I could get some more for you if we want to make more.

				How about I make 20 shirts. We put them in a pile. Those 20 will be for &quot;internal&quot; use. We will give them away or whatever. Then as a gang we can hook me up with some dank cookies (linda), some wiskey (chuck), some beer (Mike)... and take all that shit to STL and give them away too (drunken, cookie faced debauchery). I&#39;ll give away the 20 of them. If you guys have your own shirts I&#39;ll take them and print them ASAP. Otherwise the shirts I&#39;m making are for giveaway. I dont wanna charge money, but I do want some other rally people&#39;s shirts... hopefully a bandit shirt? Maybe a latebird shirt or 2. <br /><br />I laughed for 20 minutes cause Linda said &quot;dope&quot;

				Hey Kevin, how much are you paying for those Salvation Army shirts? Michael&#39;s has plain t-shirts in lots of colors and sizes on sale right now 2 for $5, and I think the last time I went to the Salvation Army in Lawrence, their t-shirts were almost that much, if not more.

				It depends sometimes 1 dolllar, sometimes 150 sometimes 2 but unless its a dress shirt, usually 2 is as high as I go. I&#39;ve paid 3 or 4 for nice shirts. I&#39;ve been creating a variety of shirts so we dont just have 100 black shirts.. I need to spend most of this week working with scott on his peds. I&#39;ll see if I cant fit in more screen printing.

				Yeah, you should bring supplies if you can. Then I can bring shirts and still get them printed, because I doubt I&#39;d be able to get them to you before then anyway (plus you probably need to work on mopeds more than you need to make t-shirts right now).
