				Are there any inspections involved Brett? What about larger machines, like 150cc? I&#39;ve got 2 &#39;peds, 3 Vespa scooters, and a Honda CT90 that need titling. If it costs $40, I&#39;ll make it worth your while. If it&#39;d look too suspicious for one guy doing all<br />of them, maybe some other Kansas peeps can help out.

				Inspections are iffy. Sometimes when you go in they&#39;ll tell you it needs to be inspected and won&#39;t hear you when you tell them it doesn&#39;t. Sometimes they don&#39;t even say the word &quot;inspection.&quot; I found a thing online that says that motorized bicycles don&#39;t need to be inspected, and I&#39;ve been telling people to print that out when they go in, because that seems like it would help convince them. <br /><br />Anything over 50cc&#39;s is a no-go, unless you want to lie about it. Usually Kansas requires a title if you want to register anything, including a moped or scooter. The loophole is that Missouri doesn&#39;t title/register anything under 50cc&#39;s, so they can&#39;t make us bring in a title if it came from a state that doesn&#39;t title them. However, Missouri does register/title 150cc scooters, right? If so, the loophole doesn&#39;t apply. If you lie about it and &quot;sell&quot; it to us as something 50cc, you won&#39;t be able to re-register it in Missouri because the Kansas title will say it&#39;s a motorized bicycle. Or well.... in Kansas, you&#39;re allowed to have anything up to 135cc&#39;s registered as a moped so long as it doesn&#39;t exceed 30mph. Lots of people register 125cc scooters as mopeds though, even though they definitely go over 30. If we lie about the displacement (125cc instead of 150) on the form/when we&#39;re talking to the people at the treasurer&#39;s office and get it registered as a moped, then when you go back to Missouri, it WILL legally be a motorcycle under Missouri law, and you might be able to register it as such. That seems like a lot of headache, though.

				Ok, so here is my challenge/proposition to any and all Kansas people.<br /><br />I will send you formal Missouri Bills of Sale (//dor.mo.gov/mvdl/motorv/forms/1957.pdf) filled out with all pertinent information. You will take it to the DMV, and work your magic. For each one of my machines that you successfully register/title, I will pay you $50, plus any fees you incur. That&#39;s 50 monies profit for your time. <br />I&#39;ll pay the fees after you are done at the DMV, and I&#39;ll pay the $50 after I receive the new Kansas title, &quot;sold&quot;/signed over to me. After that, I&#39;ll take the responsibility to get it accepted by the Missouri DMV.<br />On the bills of sale, all machines will be listed as 49cc, with proper HP, and whatnot. If you need anything else, just let me know. All I really want/need is an official piece of paper that will let me get a Missouri title. Any questions, any takers?<br /><br />NOTE: I have one machine that needs a title w/in the next couple weeks, as I&#39;m building it for sale. I&#39;d like to get that one done ASAP. No need to do everything at once, so we can experiment with titling this one first. Who&#39;s feeling adventurous?

				I&#39;d do it, or at least some of them, if I could get out of the house. Maybe later this week.... ::crosses fingers::<br /><br />I&#39;d have to check my KS titles first though, to make sure displacement isn&#39;t listed on them. I think it just says they&#39;re &quot;motorized bicycles&quot; or &quot;class MB&quot; though.

				Tell you folks what. If you want, I can take your profits and instead donate them to Linda. <br /><br />It&#39;d be rad if you could, Linda. I know how bad I was itching to just be able to be mobile in the world again, when I was recovering. Maybe you could even get pity points at the DMV for your injuries!<br /><br />It&#39;d be helpful if the Kansas titles didn&#39;t say displacement or anything. However, it&#39;s not too big of a deal I don&#39;t think. MO titles don&#39;t have a spot for displacment, and I&#39;ve got a friend @ the DMV anyway.&nbsp;

				Hello all, this is my first time on mopedstl, but I&#39;m a frequent flyer of hondaspree.net, same username.&nbsp; I may be able to help out.&nbsp; I was unsure about my title on my Elite.&nbsp; I bought it without ANYTHING, but I bought it from a guy in MO.&nbsp; I drafted up a BoS and the DMV said that mopeds under 50cc do not need a title coming from MO, just a BoS.&nbsp; If you want, and trust me, I can help you out on your titles.&nbsp; I don&#39;t have a problem taking in more than one, whats the worst they can do?&nbsp; I&#39;m buying and selling them legally.&nbsp; For an additional fee I can have titles the next day!!&nbsp; (I would have to drive 2 hours to Topeka).&nbsp; For that I would like to get everyones paperwork together and do it as a bunch.&nbsp; If you want to try a onesy or twosey to make sure I&#39;m legit, I&#39;m ok with that.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; C3.

				Yeah, this is what we all already do in KS to get titles.&nbsp; One thing you need to be careful of though is applying for too many in one year.&nbsp; If you buy and sell too many things you will be considered a dealer in the eyes of Kansas.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure what the limit is but I&#39;ve successfully titled four in one visit with no problems and probably six in one year with issue.&nbsp; I&#39;m still not sure why peeps in MO are talking about getting their stuff titled though.

				I can try a larger displacement scooter and see how that goes, but as far as registering or not registering it, I did it so I could get on/off base.&nbsp; I am stationed at Ft Leavenworth and they like to see something that says the scoot belongs to me.&nbsp; That, and I can get a title.&nbsp; That way its easier to sell, makes people feel at ease knowing its not stolen, if it ever does get stolen you have paperwork on it and not a bunch of &quot;build pics&quot; to represent your bike.&nbsp; Let me know.&nbsp; I live in Olathe until the 30th, then I move into my new house in Leavenworth.
