				Sunday afternoon, maybe? I think the weather&#39;s gonna be crappy for at least a little while, so we should take that into account. I am 100% down to get together and bake cookies for treats, though. <br /><br />Also, Brett, if you didn&#39;t find it yet:<br />http://www.frys.com/catreq/4292 (http://www.frys.com/catreq/4292)

				Sunday afternoon works for me.&nbsp; Maybe by then my treats will arrive and I will get another bike up and running.&nbsp; Which one... its suprize.<br /><br />@BeccaD&nbsp; Since I couldn&#39;t find my lower jets I went ahead and bought a massive range of dell jets from high 50&#39;s to mid 80&#39;s.&nbsp; Lets take another crack at tuning your Sachs.&nbsp; Also I would recommend a temp gauge, Your not super kitted yet, but it makes you life easier when it comes to tuning. <br /><br />@Lindar&nbsp; What size wiring nicer upper did you have.&nbsp; they sel it in diameters from 1/8th to 3/4th.&nbsp;

				I&#39;m a big fan of not having to move and having all my tools / space to work on my and other peoples bikes; however, everyone is in Lawrence and I&#39;m the only one in KC... so I&#39;ll load up and make the trek.&nbsp; &nbsp;Although if it sucks for riding, my house is pretty awesome for cooking.

				I think 1/8&quot; is too small and 3/4&quot; is probably too big. For just one or two wires, 1/4&quot; is probably good, and if you have 3 or more wires, maybe something bigger. I guess I could go measure mine and tell you for sure, though....

				Keep in mind that Cliff Drive is closed to motorized traffic on the weekends. We usually ride on it anyway but remain open to the possibility of a ticket. If large numbers of peds are down there going at high speed the cops could get called by an irate pedestrian.
