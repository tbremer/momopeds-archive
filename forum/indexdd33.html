				i took off the handle bars because they got in the way and replaced them with a joystick from a sega genesis. now the wire is getting tangled up in the peddles but im gonna fix that with a neon yellow zip tie and i wrapped the whole muffler pipe with white electrical tape because every time i paint it the paint falls off or something. the back tire had a hole in it but i fixed that by removing the inner tube and filling it with spray foam insulation.

				I doubt those spinnerz would fit a moped hub but you can run a bicycle wheel up front if you are rolling slow and want to ride http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOSOj6StQoI like my boy Luda, and if you had a spinner why wouldn&#039;t you.
