			I&#39;m having problems with my moped. It did about 20 mph when I got it, and then without any modification, it started going about 25-30. <br /><br />Now this week it went back to doing 20 mph.<br /><br />Anyone know what the deal is?

			the problem could be a number of things, an easy test is to put in a new plug... see if your performance comes back, if the old plug was black and gooey, too rich,, meaning smaller jet, or less restrictive air filter needed. the latter being the easier fix. as the days heat up tne air gets less dense, so the mixture gets richer, and that&#39;s ussually it.. now the isuue of timing, can cause performance difficulties, but the timing usually changes due to wear on the point fiber point, as it wears down, the points take a little longer to open, and retards your spark point. making it bogg more. consistincey in your fuel mixing habits can change performance as well. a richer mix can cause bogging, but a leaner mix can make it run hot, its a problematic little puzzle. I like mixing in a seperate vessel, rather than in the tank, 2% is the same as 50 to 1, but you&#39;ve got all that milliter to gallon conversion stuff, so you got get a consistent way of measuring the stuff, and you should know, how, make, 40 to 1, 50 to 1 , 32 to 1 , and know what mixing a bit richer in with the bit thinner, with whats left in the tank, or to add straight gas to thinn. it. other things, the exhaust clogs, after awhile, especially after running too rich for too long, and can throw the learning curve off, carbon build up, can effect things as well, and then there&#39;s the actual mechanical asspects, what&#39;s your commpression? how close to the end of the wear cycle is your motor, a worn engine needs more fuel to get enought power, but deposits increase, and maintence intervals have to be increased,,, sorry for the brief explaination, its getting late , and I gotta go to bed....Mark
