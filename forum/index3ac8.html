				The aerial pics don&#039;t show it very well but the turns are actually banked a little. It used to be called Spring Valley Raceway and the front was a public swimming pool. Unless you&#039;re really trying to see back there, you can&#039;t see the track or anyone on it from the road, the buildings and trees totally hide it.&nbsp; <br /><br />(//i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee214/dr_drive4130/240/22b9fdaf-d176-4831-a4cc-a0adb5ff8c2c_zps0359dc13.jpg)<br /><br />(//i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee214/dr_drive4130/240/f6c42362-b301-47ec-b0d3-ea438a77db46_zps2dd59e21.jpg)

				unless your time machine is up and running, there is no karting. <br /><br />just weeds, poison ivy, and ticks. <br /><br /><br /><br />the lawnmower inst necessary. the weeds that need cleared (for lapping) are just growing up through cracks every so many feet. <br />a team of 4 people could have it cleared in a few hours. two line-trimmers, and two guys with a leaf blower/push broom
