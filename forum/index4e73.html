				I dig this. Depending on which motor they use that could potentially be a fun bike with some work. Some things would have to go, STAT, like those mirrors, reflectors, and pretty much ALL the fairings so it doesn&#39;t look like Darth Vader&#39;s butthole. Those Honda (clone) 125s have the coolest exhaust note too, REAL deep

				i have a 125cc horizontal lifan clone motor laying around, probably a little more reliable than anything you would buy at harbor freight.&nbsp; I think they are rated 10+ hp and as cheap as $300 new, mounts are actually very close to an mb5 motor<br /><br />

				&nbsp;I have a feeling if they made them in Italy or Germany, or Japan they would cost $2999. Naked is probably next. They have several weak ass cruisers already. Most all the tooling is China factories are of Japanese origin as of they last year of two. I have seen two lengthy documentaries lately on the new Chinese production model and ethics. They are trying to emulate the Japanese principals of quality and soul. They know if they can produce shit with quality and reliability anywhere close to Japan with there prices they could eventually over come there shitty reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;Most of us know that when it comes to the three wants, cheap, great performance, reliability, you can only get two of the three at any one time. Its china&#39;s vision to over come this. Fucking bitches. Or maybe we are the bitches for not doing it first.

				&nbsp;I slapped a 80cc kit on a Chinese 50cc and it was a piece of cake. Being that its only $1500 ish why couldent someone slapp a 250cc kit on it? Those kits are cheap, and would make HWY ridding very easy. New it would be a hell of a lot cheaper then a used ninja. Anyway who cares im not buying one.

				&nbsp;One other thing is that they are pretty much a full size frame so how would a cop even know if they are street legal or not. A cop couldn&#39;t tell if it was a 1000cc or a 150cc. Cops are stupid when it comes to that fine live between legal and illegal cc&#39;s as long as your not doing 45mph down the HWY.

				You can pick up a used-but-good-shape Ninja/Rebel/Nighthawk/etc. for $1000-$2000, all day long. Sometimes less! And that&#39;s just 250s, you can get other displacements in that price range too.

				If you wouldn&#39;t trust the motor to get you anywhere, would you trust the essential parts to keep you rolling? what happens when the shit quality bearings lock up at speed on the highway? or you hit the brakes in a tight spot where you REALLY need to stop and they just fall apart or shatter?<br /><br />i like your idea, its something I&#39;ve wanted to do too, but more so as a slightly more powerful one-off bike in addition to my peds. great idea, i wouldn&#39;t trust chinese parts until they prove a bit more quality.

There are a lot of customer ratings you can look into as well as tons of new Chinese 125cc motorcycle threads with real people discussing any and all issues they have came up, from my quick glance, seamed to be more centered around modifying rather them complaints about crappy parts. They are Chinese of course so there is an expectation of lesser quality when purchased. I guess until someone we know actually buys one and runs the shit out of It we will never really know. Someone buy one and rock that shit!!!

				Today on CNN they said China started an Airliner plant, making there version of an air buss. Many diff air liners, and they have hundreds of orders, Yes a Chines air bus. Insane! Seats are pennies on the dollar.<br /><br />//www.wired.com/Utopia/2009/03/china-rushes-in/ (//www.wired.com/Utopia/2009/03/china-rushes-in/)<br /><br />//www.dancewithshadows.com/flights/boeing-airbus-china-aircraft.asp (//www.dancewithshadows.com/flights/boeing-airbus-china-aircraft.asp)<br /><br />&nbsp;Whats the world coming to? They are saying the product is the same quality, and the labor cost is the only thing that is diff. They employ a Japanese CEO and tooling with the cheapest labor on the planet. it is not restricted to Japanese CEO&#39;s, there are many American company&#39;s sprouting up with American tooling and China&#39;s labor army, or German etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;Do to the massive amount of jobs though along with China&#39;s previous strict birth laws comes a pinch, china is just beginning to have to be competitive with its pay. As time goes on the more competitive until it is yet again cost affective to manufacture in America. The Global Market will find a balance. We may never make toasters again but we will have massive gains in innovative product manufacturing. <br /><br /><br /><br />
