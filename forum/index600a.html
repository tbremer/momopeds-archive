				it was more like a kind gesture, a sign of respect.<br /><br />also he&#39;s a cool friend that didn&#39;t want to step on anybody&#39;s toes.<br /><br />as in we didn&#39;t tell him that we were not going to be putting on a rally this year.<br /><br />and he didn&#39;t want to do the same stuff that we had been doing in previous years.<br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="indexafc9.html?topic=7388.msg85043#msg85043">Quote from: Optik on August 04, 2011, 10:00:05 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">BMW??

				when you don&#39;t communicate with anyone for a year, people start thinking things like where are they? why dont they ride? are they ok? do they still like riding? then when you post its kind of a &quot;where have you guys been because we ride all the time&quot; thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />that being said, optik lets not thread jack... hope this event goes well.
