				So we talked about a rally for like 3 days.&nbsp; Then silence.&nbsp; Are we doing it?&nbsp; We need to plan it if we are.&nbsp; And we need to advertise to get people to come.<br /><br />Ideas were to include using Fort Hinrichs as a base.&nbsp; Planning some long day rides, getting some bars or other places to do drink specials and host a moped party, contests/awards, races, etc.<br /><br />I guess it all hinges on using Fort Hinrichs as a base or not, and where people can stay overnights.&nbsp; Of course there are hotels, but it would be cool to camp somewhere, or take over a youth hostel or something.<br /><br />What do we think?

				I am of course still up for it, I think fall would be better than end of summer just because of searching for sponsors and all of that jazz, pluss getting a couple of fast peds and routes; dont want it lookong like KZoo did. hah.<br /><br />Does Ryne still have that list of ideas? I am at work so I will ask my GM about renting the small side.

				See, a rally in the fall would be easier to plan, but Ryne moves to KC on Aug 1st, and Alex leaves the 14th.&nbsp; So we kinda need to do it...very soon.<br /><br />Yeah, we need to plan some good rides, get some more kitted bikes in our ranks (like, more than just Dave&#39;s grande), get sponsors, find places for people to stay, break down trucks for the rides, etc...<br /><br />If we don&#39;t think we can pull it off and do it well, I&#39;d personally rather wait until next year.&nbsp; It would be crappy to get out of towners to come to something that seems half-assed because we ran out of time.&nbsp; I&#39;m not saying we can&#39;t pull off something awesome, but we need to get on it like today if we&#39;re going to do it.<br /><br />So basically I think we should plan a rally, or we should do some other stuff that is just locally based.&nbsp; Like the Call To Arms thread says, we have a lot we can and need to do with our own group here.<br />

				I think, if those are the oqtions we should focus more on local activity, maybe even plan a big 50cc ride in conjunction with scooter saint louis, so when rally season nextyear comes around we can have our name out there and possible sponsors already know us.

				MA might make funny noises at the aspect of riding with a scooter club. (as in moped army has been known to bitch and moan). But then again, all the other reasons sound pretty good.<br /><br />isn&#39;t that what happened to KC?

				I think the Breakfast Mafia didn&#39;t get in because not too many MA members knew them, and a few members decided to pick on them because they rode with scooters.&nbsp; Those few bullies tipped opinion against them, and they didn&#39;t get in.&nbsp; Or at least that&#39;s how I understand the story.&nbsp; I know some of you KC folk check this board, so correct me if I&#39;m wrong.

				Fuck the MA if thats the case, spreading the word and being locally active are two huge things that are required to be accepted, group-think is the death of evrything good. haha

				HEy guys...The Breakfast mafia is coming to your rally.&nbsp; If you need help, flyers, or whatever let me know.&nbsp; I have to bring the kids so I&#39;ll have the support vehicle for the rally.&nbsp; So I guess we could bring Ryne with us! When you guys are at the bar I&#39;m going to take the kids sight seeing so I don&#39;t have to explain why I have 2 year old wort that looks like a kid strapped to me:P As for the Scooters...we ride out here with them.&nbsp; we did get A LOT of shit for it but who cares.&nbsp; The scooter people are in just as much danger as we are when on the road.&nbsp; Besides this year rally has scooters in it.&nbsp; Most of the people that have scooters say they want mopeds but can&#39;t find them.&nbsp; We are not a branch of MA so if they give us shit well..who cares.&nbsp; For the reason we didn&#39;t get in is because not enough of us had been to other rallies...I guess...they don&#39;t give you a definite reason.&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t really matter...we are all about the ride!&nbsp; Most of the people that we have met from MA have been really really cool...and helpful.&nbsp; Its just the hand full that are asses about the scooter thing.&nbsp; BTW...I can&#39;t seem to type things that make sense so...if this reads funny sorry...I should go get a scan of my brain:)

				Heres my 2 cents<br /><br />Take these Mafia folk on ride through the italian hill neigborhood from Marks, then to Forest Park for the exeptional free Zoo, art museum and Science center . ANd ride around FP....it could be a nice mini-ride, I think there from Marks is only like3-5 miles, and it has that bike friendly path deal...<br /><br />whatever, a penny for everyones thoughts..
