				I think that Fort Hinrichs is setting up to be the bulk of where folk stay...the yard has tent space for campers, last time most people slept in VW busses that Mark hordes in his yard. <br /><br />Toms, Beth, Mike &amp; Annie all live less than 1/4&nbsp; mile from the fort...Tracy &amp; I&nbsp; live about 5 miles from the fort...<br />I believe all of us are offering housing...<br /><br />

				Ok my ped/peds will be fine. If nothing else.. Scott can ride one of mine. I&#39;d rather we work on fixing his though. <br /><br />Myself and Scott will be staying at my parents place. We will stay up late and hang out, but we gotta make it home sometime. <br /><br />
