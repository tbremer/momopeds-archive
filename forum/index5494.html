				ok...took my rear wheel off due to a flat tire... <br />got to pokin around a bit more and checked out the drive shaft and brakes (what brakes?) and what not. <br />ending up taking the shock off and to make a short story shorter, i cant get the thing back on. <br />The shock rotates, but it doesn&#39;t seem to make it any shorter or longer, and i just get the feeling that it isn&#39;t supposed to be compressed or anything...here&#39;s some pics<br /><br />(//i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee277/johngilbreth/my%20mercedes%20and%20my%20scooter/qt-50-shock-side.jpg)<br /><br />another angle...<br /><br />(//i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee277/johngilbreth/my%20mercedes%20and%20my%20scooter/qt-50-shock-rear.jpg)<br /><br />and attached at the crank case and missing under the gas tank...just put on the other way around<br /><br />(//i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee277/johngilbreth/my%20mercedes%20and%20my%20scooter/qt-50-heres-another-angle.jpg)<br /><br />is there an order of operation that I have to follow? or did the shock take steroids? or am i stupid?<br /><br />side note...<br />I downloaded a copy of the qt50 shop manual and have been lookin through it<br />this always cracks me up...just thought i&#39;d share<br />(//i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee277/johngilbreth/my%20mercedes%20and%20my%20scooter/qt50shopmanualfunnystuff.jpg)<br /><br />have a good day gangstas<br /><br />

				Lift the frame up off the ground and swing the rear hub down. It looks like that needs to be @ an angle, so the shock can drop down further. It should hook up then.

				Yeah,&nbsp; what Val said.&nbsp; You need to lift the frame up by the seat while at the same time taking weight off the rear wheel.&nbsp; They will meet up.&nbsp; Try one hand lifting on the back of the fuel tank, one hand lifting the rear wheel from the brake assembly and your third hand positioning the shock to line up with the bolt hole.&nbsp; <br /><br />-b
