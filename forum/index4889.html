				Cheesy sweater ride, let&#39;s say two weeks from now? That&#39;d be the weekend before Austin. Friday the 15th, Saturday the 16th, or Sunday the 17th. We have to deal with fewer people if we do it Friday, but we get maximum cheesy sweater exposure if we do it on Saturday or Sunday. Hours are 9am to 6pm. Hit up those thrift shops now, because you&#39;re gonna need time to find something that tops my sweater. <br /><br />Austin, fuck yes I&#39;m in. Everyone, PLEASE figure out whether you&#39;ve got the time/funds to go to that. As soon as I get a head count, I can work on figuring out transportation and costs. Even without any info on any of that, though, I think it ought to be less than $100.

				Crazy idea, but it might be the most comfortable and less exhausting and cramped idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;If we rented a tour buss we could all ride in comfort with our peds underneith.&nbsp; Ash has origonized a tour buss before and says there like 2,000 plus a hotel room for the driver.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sounds expensive, but if we got other members from the Midwest moped collective in on it it could be cheeper then taking down a convoy of cars.&nbsp; &nbsp;20 people at 100 each offsets the 2 g&#39;s

				Brett, I think it&#39;s a good thought, but you know us ... there&#39;s no way it would ever work. Even if Justin comes, we&#39;re up to 9 people. Where are we going to find 11 more who have the time and the funds for the bus? Most of those people would probably have to come from outside Lawrence/KC too, so they&#39;d have to pay to get here plus for the bus. Even if you get it all set up and it isn&#39;t too expensive, you know someone&#39;s gonna flake at the last minute, and that screws the rest of us over. Also, our track record on getting everyone to pay in equally is not the greatest (this is not directed at anyone, it&#39;s more a comment that as far as I know, we never got money stuff completely sorted out from WB3 or the rally).<br /><br />You&#39;re welcome to look into it, and if you think it could be promising, then I&#39;d love to hear more. But given the info we&#39;ve got, and knowing our track record, I&#39;m dubious. <br /><br />While we&#39;re on the subject of transportation, Brett, assuming we don&#39;t come up with anything better, would you be willing to drive your Jeep and pull a trailer with a butt-ton of mopeds on it? And does anyone have a really big trailer? If we&#39;ve got more than 8 people, we&#39;d have to put the middle seat back in my van, so it can&#39;t take any mopeds. Thus, we&#39;d need a trailer that can hold 8-10 mopeds. Or we need a third vehicle, preferably one that gets good gas mileage.&nbsp;

				The only bad thing about using my car and trailer is that, my trailer isn&#39;t big enough, my car gets hella bad gas millage, its cramped and loud for anyone inside the cab.&nbsp; Also driving to Grand Rapids and back with only 4 peds on my trailer took about a half inch of tread off my rear tires.&nbsp; I will see if I can get a hold of my grandfathers truck this time.&nbsp; It would be able to haul 5 people, 4 peds, and he has a nice trailer that is bigger then mine, might be able to get 6 to 10 peds on it

				Yeah, I know I&#39;ve heard you say all that stuff about your car before, so I figured it&#39;d be the same case here. I think you&#39;re the only one of us who has a vehicle that can really pull a trailer loaded down like that, so that&#39;s why I asked. If you could get your grandfather&#39;s truck, that&#39;d be awesome. And if us paying him some money would help, then I can add that into cost calculations.

				If I can persuade him to let us borrow it the only compensation needed might be the gas cost of going of getting it and returning it.&nbsp; Since its in Pratt that might be 60ish dollars.&nbsp; <br /><br />I really hoped I can get this, but don&#39;t put your hoped on it.&nbsp; I went down to visit him in the hospital this past weekend and hes not doing to terribly well.

				It&#39;s all good dude. At least we know now rather than like, the day we&#39;re leaving. <br /><br />WHICH REMINDS ME. <br /><br />Everyone else whose name I have on that list. I need &lt;b&gt;COMMITMENTS&lt;/b&gt; by tomorrow (preferably) or Friday (at the very latest). Aka, if you commit, you will NOT flake at the last minute. We&#39;re trying to work out planning and vehicles, and it&#39;s going to seriously fuck over everyone who is going if you say you are and then you decide you aren&#39;t at the last minute. <br /><br />I&#39;m still thinking/hoping it will be less than $100/person for gas. The sooner I get commitments, the sooner I can tell everyone exactly how much it&#39;ll be. You NEED to bring cash. Like, for real this time. I know, I&#39;m a plastic person too. But it&#39;s waaaaay too confusing trying to get everyone to pay up equally and remember who put in how much where, then get people who put in more back their money (etc) when one or two people use their credit cards. If you have a problem with this, let me know ahead of time, and we&#39;ll figure something out. <br /><br />Sorry if I sound like a heinous bitch and I&#39;m sucking all the fun out of this. Really, that&#39;s not my intention. I just don&#39;t want to see people get screwed over on gas again, I don&#39;t want to be standing there at the last minute making everyone cough up more money because someone flaked, and I don&#39;t want us standing around at the last minute realizing that we don&#39;t have people/ped space for everyone. <br /><br />&lt;3 you all.

				Okay, here&#39;s the plan, dawgs. <br /><br />Who: We have 7 people going (see list above). We&#39;re taking my van and Brett&#39;s jeep. We&#39;re putting 4 people and 2 peds in my van, and we&#39;re putting 3 people and 5 peds in/with Brett&#39;s jeep. It&#39;s going to suck giant hairy monkey balls for everyone, so deal with it. Everyone, please try to get a good night sleep on Wednesday night. We will be driving through the night, and we will probably need to take shifts at that so nobody gets stuck doing all of it and being super cranky and tired the next day. We do not have space for a spare bike, so please, bring something you trust. <br /><br />How much: I have my van down at 21mpg and Brett&#39;s jeep down for 12mpg. With 7 people going, I&#39;ve got that at $75/person. I have not included the customary &quot;add $5-10 for extra padding&quot; to that number, because it&#39;s high enough as it is. Just saying this now so you know that there shouldn&#39;t be a bunch left over (and there is a small chance you&#39;ll be asked to pitch in some more, but hopefully my miles and mileage padding will be enough). Again: BRING CASH. If you absolutely must use a card, please tell me that ahead of time. <br /><br />When/Where: We&#39;re leaving on Thursday night, time TBA. It&#39;s gotta be after 10 though, because I work until 10. Brett&#39;s gonna drive to Lawrence, we&#39;ll load up, and be on our way. Ed, if you see this, let me know if you guys want to meet us here or in Ottawa or whatever else. Brett, I assume you&#39;re picking Justin up?<br /><br />Miscellaneous: We may stop in Waco on the way down to hang out with Brett&#39;s parents for a little bit.

				I am going to try and sneak out of work early on Thursday and head straight for Blue springs to pick up the Hobbit and the Justin.&nbsp; Then we will be heading back to Lawrence, probably be in town by 8:00.&nbsp; We can start loading up with out the Lindar because its going to take magic moped orgamie skills to fit 5 mopeds on my trailer.&nbsp; <br /><br />It would me nice to stop by my fokes, if even for a brief leg stretch.&nbsp; There house is less than a mile away from I35 and I am sure my mom would make us all lunch if we decided to stop.&nbsp; Waco about 3 hours north of Austin, I will let the group make the call on stopping though.&nbsp;

				It might be better to just head to Lawrence Ed.&nbsp; There will be a few hours once I get into town with the trailer when we will be waiting on Linda to get off work.&nbsp; That would be the perfect time to load up.&nbsp; I would like to get all the peds on the trailer at one time so we dont have to take them all off and reconfigure them in the parking lot of Walmart. <br /><br />I would be fine with just picking you guys up if we could put both you peds in Linda&#39;s van... but something tells me that your Gigantic springer forks will make it a tight squeeze.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />As I can imagine it the smallest bikes will get shoved into Lindas van:&nbsp; Trin&#39;s Nostalgia and Kendin&#39;s Pinto.&nbsp; <br />and the rest of the larger peds will some how get arranged on my trailer:&nbsp; Grand Prix, Hobbit, Ed&#39;s bike, FreeSpirit, Mikes Mad Max Magnum.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course Linda can always pull rank and say that her ped rides with her, in that case Trin&#39;s Puch is on the trailer and the Pinto and FreeSpirit are in the van.&nbsp;

				Actually, you know what might be easiest? Why make you drive all the way to Lawrence if you don&#39;t need to? Me, Beez, and Kenden can head down to Ottawa in my van. We might have to take the front wheel off the Magnum or something, but I think we can get all 3 bikes in there. You and Justin can just take I-35 down to Ottawa from KC, and Ed and Trinity can meet us there. We can just say everyone meet at the Wal-Mart at like, 11? Then we can rearrange people/bikes once we all meet up. <br /><br />And Kenden wants the Pinto in my van, which makes sense since that&#39;s definitely the smallest bike. I&#39;m not taking the Free Spirit (it&#39;ll probably be the Swinger instead, but I&#39;d like some riding time this week just to make sure it stays reliable). I&#39;d prefer to have my bike in my van, but we&#39;ll see how it all works out. <br /><br />ALSO. I&#39;m gonna change it to $80/person, because I&#39;m a horrible mean person like that. I re-did the mileage on Brett&#39;s jeep from KC instead of Lawrence, and that added a little. Plus I like buffer funds. Plus then we aren&#39;t as likely to have to make change.

				That works for me.&nbsp; If anyone has any extra ratchet strapes, bring them so we can treat our mopeds all nice and good like.

				Final reminder!<br /><br />Everyone be at the Wal-Mart in Ottawa by 11 on Thursday night. Each person needs to bring $80, cash. As Brett said, ratchet straps are good (I have some, but not enough for everyone). Bring a reliable bike, because we don&#39;t have room for spares. And don&#39;t forget your phone chargers, ipod chargers, chargers for whatever other important devices you have, WARM jackets, and sleeping bags. <br /><br />Brett, I&#39;m not sure how much room we&#39;ve got, but unless someone has already claimed space for us at an ACR house, I assume we&#39;re at the warehouse, and having a tent to provide some kind of barrier between us and everyone else wouldn&#39;t be bad.

				I inquired about some space but our previous most gracious host has moved to a new smaller house with his GF and out of the palatial digs. Therefore it is the carpeted warehouse for our merry band, I also have an equal sized tent if it is needed.

				I have pics, but they&#39;re on my camera which is out in my car and I really don&#39;t want to go get it right now. To tide you all over, imagine riding across this:<br /><br />//maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=115381695853548380070.000492ae5e0bf000bf63c&amp;ll=30.346334,-97.799059&amp;spn=0,0.009645&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=30.346441,-97.798992&amp;panoid=HGRaBeXBxYA4sqQH06hJ2g&amp;cbp=12,12.37,,0,7.1<br /><br />And make sure you look at the extra images for that area, plus go up and down the road a little. <br /><br />Other favorite things: I think I am now addicted to breakfast burritos. That&#39;s going to be my new go-to breakfast food. The boat party was epic. I even drank! (You should all be so proud.) The rides in general were amazing. Hospitality was amazing. They had everything planned, and it all ran more or less on time and without a hitch. As Beez said, you all missed OUT.
