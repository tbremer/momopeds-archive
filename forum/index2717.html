			Send me an email or pm, I may not check this thread for awhile.&nbsp; I am keeping one citta and a bravo from this bunch but I have 2 extra citta and one extra bravo that I will be parting with.&nbsp; They all need a little work now, I would sell as is to get money for a kit and pipe for the bravo otherwise I will give them some attention and sell on cl later.&nbsp; The bravo is euro style w/&nbsp; sguare seat post.<br />I would also trade for a grande nice paint and seat, forks...better if it does but I don&#039;t really need wheels or subframe.
