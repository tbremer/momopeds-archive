				hi everyone,<br /><br />just wanted to announce my presence...i&#39;ve been lurking for a bit now.&nbsp; south city STL dweller here, benton park to be exact.<br /><br />i&#39;m currently riding an 82 NU50m that i&#39;ve nursed back to health after some front end damage by the previous owner.&nbsp; new forks, bearings, footpegs, and a bunch of cleaning, and this thing is back on track.&nbsp; currently hitting ~28mph on flats, ~33-35 on hills, and of course i&#39;m wanting to get it going a little faster.&nbsp; there&#39;s plenty of time for that discussion, though.&nbsp; right?<br /><br />so yeah.&nbsp; hello?&nbsp; hello.

				I&#39;ve tried it stock and with 3 weights out.&nbsp; I like the pickup I get with only 3 weights, but I miss the top end of having all 6.&nbsp; I plan on getting a few different weights and trying different combos with the notched variator.&nbsp; What kind of weights are you running?

				I run three six gram weights, with my kit/pipe combo it revs directly into the powerband. When I was a stock bike boy I ran the three stock weights, paired with the Dayton 5L330 belt I picked up 6mph on my high end. You loose some accel with the belt, but it&#39;s totally worth it. <br /><br />What&#39;s next on your work list for this bike? I totally suggest the belt, roasting the pipe on a fire to clean out the build up, disabling the oil injection and running a 40:1 premix.

				Hmm.&nbsp; Well, the old belt was starting to dry rot when i got the bike, so I put on a Gates bx31.&nbsp; Looks like that Dayton belt is even wider than the bx31.&nbsp; Interesting.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been thinking about getting a new exhaust soon.&nbsp; Seems like the next most logical place to look for speed after the variator/belt combo is running well.<br /><br />I&#39;ve read a lot about disabling the oil injection.&nbsp; Obviously it simplifies things a lot - is that the big draw there, or is there some other benefit to performance?

				Well these old oil injectors eventually fail, and they do so without warning, then the bike seizes hard and then the good times stop rolling. The oil pump unit also gets in the way of having easy carb access. And when you take out the oil tank you can stick the battery under the seat, it opens up the lines of the bike a bit. Disabling the oil injector is something you&#39;ll have to do once you start making performance mods, as the pump won&#39;t keep the proper ratio.<br /><br />&nbsp;The proma circuit is a great pipe on a either a stock or kitted set-up. You&#39;ll have to do some bracket modding and lose the center stand, but it levels the hills for ya, blasty blasty 40ish.

				So are you just rockin a side stand on yours with that pipe?&nbsp; If so, what kind?<br /><br />Guess I&#39;ll have to start working on disabling that oil injector.&nbsp; So have you had to adjust your gas/oil ratio much with each of the performance mods you&#39;ve done?

				Well, I must confess, the NU50&#39;s been on the backburner for a bit - home remodeling, getting a record release together for my band, work, etc.&nbsp; (plus I bought that motobecane sebring from declan a while back, so i dialed that in and have been riding it to+from work for the most part)<br /><br />Buuuut...the Urbie lost the oil injection, gained a hi flow filter, a little upjet, a notched variator and some lighter weights.&nbsp; Oddly enough, it seems to be topping out at about 27-28 even though it was going faster than that before the extras.&nbsp; Or maybe I&#39;m imagining things.&nbsp; My wife&#39;s started riding the NU50 a lot lately, but she&#39;s (understandably) wanting to go faster.<br /><br />I got a super deal on a Jarmacol pipe for it, but quickly realized that I need some help figuring out how to mount it up, probably a hack+weld job (and i&#39;ve never welded...).&nbsp; <br /><br />You dudes want to throw down an Urban Express party sometime soon?
