				Got drafted by the PTA for some thing my daughter is in. Ex-wife called me 20 minutes ago and told me she had been up all night baking stuff for this and apparently I was sdupposed to psychically know I was needed. So I&#39;ll let you guys know when I escape, fix the car, and get ready.

				Never underestimate the treachery of women, guys. I arrived thinking I&#39;m doing a concession stand or something and ended up taking the Ex&#39;s place as a debate judge. There were apparently three nights of training to do this, which neither of us attended. I faked my way through it but the day is shot again. Tomorrow I&#39;m riding, somewhere.

				Sigh. We need more girls. I can&#39;t hope to quash all of your all&#39;s heathen tendencies and mistrust of females by myself. <br /><br />I can&#39;t go anywhere or do anything tomorrow. I haz 3 projects I&#39;ll be working on.

				There isn&#39;t time for mopeds when it takes the computer 4 hours to cut something down and I have to run back to the computer lab every hour to keep it from logging me off.

				You are a beacon of logic and civility in these matters, and I encourage your support of getting more members of the opposite sex into riding. This is all working in my favor in the eyes of my daughter, I&#39;m all reliable an stuff. Truly an hour of mopeding has been known to improve intelligence by 10 I.Q. points - mopedstl.com 2009.

				If I can get the Tomos put back together soon, I&#39;ll drag my sister along one of these weeks. <br /><br />Hmm... I wonder .... maybe if I set my phone to vibrate, and then stuck it under the mouse, and set alarms to go off every 55 minutes or so, maybe that would be enough movement to keep it from logging me off. Must experiment with this...

				They&#39;re lab computers. I&#39;m sure there is something that can be changed, but I wouldn&#39;t be allowed to access those settings. Either way, even if my plan worked for one computer, that still wouldn&#39;t help, because we&#39;ve got 6 images that all need to be processing at once. <br /><br />And it&#39;s so nice out too!! Grrrrrrrrrr. <br />
