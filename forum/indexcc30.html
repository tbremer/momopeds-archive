			<strong>JSTarga</strong>:
			<br />
			Sometime between 9p-6a last night/today someone ripped my garage door open and stole my 94 Targa LX in the Tower Grove Heights neighborhood. If you see this around town please let me know and spread the word. I have attached a picture, forest green, couple stickers on it (Treatland sticker on the rear splash guard under the tail light) but they could have easily been removed. Thank you.
