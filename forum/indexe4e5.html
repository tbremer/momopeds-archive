				so this guy had his vespa grande stolen here in lawrence prob 5 months ago and was posting all over CL about it. so i got in contact with him to try to help, he was so desperate to find his moped he told me &quot;ill give u 500 dollars if u find my moped or help me find it&quot; so i told him to check the alleys around his house and it was 2 blocks away next to a dumpster. So he messaged me back and was sooo excited about finding it, half of me wanted to say &quot;dont u owe me some money?&quot; but im not a dick.

				Alright already, Beff!!&nbsp; Congrats on getting the Pinto back.&nbsp; Hopefully the thief didn&#39;t ride it enough to hurt anything.<br /><br />Maybe, with some luck your other peds (and Loren&#39;s) will be found, and in good shape, as well.
