				I talked to some of the guys who are throwing the party for everything 2 wheeled at the Beaumont this Saturday.&nbsp; &nbsp;They told me that people will start showing up around noon and then a ride leaves from the back yard of the club at 2pm.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lets all meet up at my place at noon and then ride over together to rep the underpowered 2stroke darlings of KC.

				The maxi I think. Bearings are in the oven right now....fuck chinese bearings for life. I thought I found the one that was crunchy, but I was so worried I replaced them all. It was a good move, because after I got them all off and compared them to the new SKF bearings it was night and day.

				did you get new seals too.&nbsp; because the way your bike sounded and was running it had the symptoms of a seal leak.

				Yeah I dunno why it sounded so shitty on sunday, it was hella wet. The seals all look good, but better safe than sorry I guess. Wouldn&#39;t a shitty seal look blown out? I didn&#39;t have any ATF anywhere it shouldn&#39;t be, so it&#39;s not like a seal was leaking.

				Really? I thought if you had a blown seal there would be tranny fluid in my stator or on my sprocket? Someone school me if I&#39;m wrong.<br /><br />I replaced them just to be safe, but it would be cool to know how to identify this issue in the future. It did sound really bad....

				On a Tomos, a bad clutch-side crank seal will cause you to burn copious amounts of transmission fluid, resulting in a cloud of white smoke. I would assume a Puch would be the same way, although it doesn&#39;t seem to be a common problem with Puchs. Or rather, I hear about bearings going bad a lot more than I hear about seals going bad on Puchs. <br /><br />I did have a leaky flywheel-side seal on my Puch once, and the engine cases behind the stator plate were oily and black. It ran lean, but it didn&#39;t seem to affect the transmission fluid at all. <br /><br />So maybe it depends on which seal is bad?

				Linda*s&nbsp; right.<br />clutch side leaky seal would draw tranny fluid into the combustion chamber.<br />weepy flywheel seal makes it messy in the timing chest<br />Optik don*t know nothing

				agreed the hills suck, but you cant have it both ways on a single speed.<br /><br />gotta have 2 at the very least, or better yet 3. otherwise your taking the long way around.<br /><br />I don&#39;t want to lead a pity-party about the rally, but there where certainly some shortcomings (like riding up ward parkway in rush hour traffic).<br /><br />the guys that put this on all ride p200&#39;s or similar (et4&#39;s and larger), they don&#39;t really sympathise with us.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It was great to see ya&#39;ll. It was a good thing that I didn&#39;t go on the ride, on my trip home my voltage regulator sheared a bolt and lost ground in the Plaza. So it wouldn&#39;t run with the headlight and taillight on. I switched it over to coil only and rode to Shawnee, where my buddy lent me a woodscrew, and some speaker wire to get me back on to I-35 and back to Richmond. Sorry to hear about your friend, she seemed very nice.&nbsp;
