			this is were we all work on peds and hang out. It is a work in progress. The yellow pa50 and grande are mine. The rest are projects that are getting completed (someday). The motorized bike is my buddy sams, he lives in a upstairs apartment and wanted a ped. We came to the conclusion that the easy to carry bike was up his alley.

			Sweet. I think the grande looks so much better without covers and stuff.

			Woah, never seen an all yellow hobbit.&nbsp; Nice score!<br /><br />And yeah, Grandes look sweet stripped down.&nbsp; But then again I think all bikes look better stripped of fenders and such.
