			HEEYYYYY guys, so I really want to title my express. I completely don&#039;t know where to start or if I can even get this done. I don&#039;t have a bill of sale of title for the frame so that&#039;s where I&#039;m at.

			I&#039;ve done it twice.<br /><br />1) Get someone to give you a bill of sale and get it notarized when they sign it in front of the notary<br />[I&#039;ll do it if no one else will, but I can&#039;t notarize and I don&#039;t have a local bank]<br />2) Get this:<br />//dmv.vermont.gov/sites/dmv/files/pdf/DMV-VD119-Vehicle_Reg_Tax_Title_App.pdf<br /><br />1A: New<br />1B: Motorcycle<br />2: Do all of this <br />3A, 3B: Skip<br />3C: do this<br />3D: skip<br />4A: do this<br />Where it says VT Driver License No, put your Missouri Driver License Number. This is very important.<br />Personally, I put mine and then put [MO] after it.<br />4B: skip<br />5A: skip<br />5B: Name/address of your notarized bill of sale<br />6A: Put purchase price that is reasonable and then also put the tax of 6% at the bottom<br />DO NOT PUT $1 or whatever. They will charge you the fair market value lowest price and send the application back if you put a number that is too low.*<br />If possible use Blue Book or something &quot;official&quot; because that&#039;s what they use, and they will charge you<br />6B: Blank<br />7: Blank<br />8: Sign and date<br />9: Go to their website and figure out the fees. <br />Again, if you fuck this up, they&#039;ll send it back to you, hopefully with the correct numbers. So don&#039;t sweat it.<br /><br /><br />* Which is okay if you&#039;re not in a hurry, then you&#039;ll know the minimum to put. But at 6% for a moped the price is so low it doesn&#039;t really save you a lot.
