			Hello, I have a 1980 tomos silver bullet a3 that I bought in 2011 &amp; seized the engine. I then bought a 94 tomos targa lx and was riding it long story shirt had some things come up so they got garaged.so now three yrs later I wanna get these going. I live infront of the city museum and saw a gang go by the other week and said damnit I need to get these running. I recently took the head off the a3 and now I can move the pedals and the piston moves. That was a fun walk back from Delmar lifting the back end and steering the front lol. I have some mechanical skills but never really worked on a moped. I&#039;ve read a lot but can only get so much from text.<br /><br />1994 targa lx plans: <br /><br />64cc air sail kit, dellorto 15.15 carb (can&#039;t find intake anywhere) estriol pipe<br />I need new tires (would like some spoke wheels but can&#039;t find any) <br />I wanna replace all gaskets and seals/bearings<br />Not sure what else needs done as I haven&#039;t opened them up yet<br /><br />1980 silver bullet a3 plans: <br /><br />Since it seized before should I replace the cylinder or just hone it and but a new piston kit with a high comp head<br />This ones the ladies bike so just wanna replace exhaust, carb, and figure out the cylinder issue<br /><br />I wanna get rolling again&nbsp; and am willing to pay for your time as time is money. I&#039;ll do the work if u want as I&#039;d like to learn u can get paid and just guide me how about it? Lol anyways any help would be greatly appreciated. I&#039;m also up for helping labor wise at the skate park i saw on the website if you still need help. Thanks again and hope to be riding soon.

			Hello, my phone won&#039;t let me pm you. I was wondering if you still would be interested in helping me learn to get my tomos up and running. I&#039;ve got the engine pulled but can&#039;t get the stator nut off. I have a piston stop and flywheel puller. I live right on Washington ave so I&#039;m not too far from you. I have a puch za50 cdi I want to install along with a airsal 65cc kit and estroil pipe with a dellorto 15.15 carb. I got the new tires on but the engine stuff I&#039;m weary about. Ill pay you cash to teach me. I&#039;d like to learn because I love mopeds and already have two and would like to be able to maintain them. Thanks a lot. My email is musicsaves84@gmail.com or my num is 314-459-1200 thanks a lot <br /><br />Bill
