					I visited with Mark yesterday afternoon (September 4).&nbsp; He was still feeling okay without pain medication.&nbsp; He did sneeze once and that caused him some pain, but only for the time of the sneeze.&nbsp; We laughed a lot.&nbsp; He said he was hoping to go home today or Saturday. He will have a &quot;bag&quot; that collects the contents of his intestines.&nbsp; His intestines were injured by the bullet.&nbsp; He said the nurses were teaching him how to tend the bag until his intestines heal.&nbsp; He was in great spirits and I am sure he welcomes any visitors.&nbsp; Check with Mike or me as to how to gain access to his room.&nbsp; The hospital protects their patients by making you know how to get in.&nbsp; You cannot just ask for Mark by name.&nbsp; Go see him.&nbsp; Like me, you will be glad you did.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dave

					Ok, I guess for shopping purposes, I could say I paid $250 for my Vespa Grande at a pawn shop.&nbsp; It was running, but barely.&nbsp; I kitted it up to 64cc and changed the muffler to a free-flowing one.&nbsp; I now have about $500 and a lot of hours in it.&nbsp; It is extremely dependable, but then again, I did not go to extremes in getting performance out of it.&nbsp; I can hit 30 easily and 35 over a l-o-n-g time.<br /><br />I paid $80 for my non-running Puch-powered JC Penney at a county fair.&nbsp; I invested another $200 and a lot of hours to get it running and to get some non-rusted rims and such.&nbsp; It runs dependably and well for a completely stock ped.<br /><br />When I say I have &quot;a lot of hours&quot; in my mopeds, I mean I spent time trying to reduce rust appearances and spent A LOT of time checking all timing, points, compression, lubrication, adjustments, etc. while learning how they work.&nbsp; Anyone shopping for his first moped should not expect to just jump on it and ride unless he purchases from someone who did all that work for the buyer.&nbsp; Even then, the buyer should spend lots of time learning how they work so he/she can fix it.<br /><br />So yes, I have a couple of good mopeds.&nbsp;

					You might start by attending some moped Fix-it days.&nbsp; Ask what kind of problems attendees have had with their mopeds.&nbsp; Learn how easy (or difficult or expensive) the fix was.&nbsp; Then, as you shop you will know this or that problem with a moped you are viewing is an easy or difficult (or expensive) fix.&nbsp; That way you can adjust how much you are willing to pay for said moped.&nbsp; You would feel more comfortable knowing you are purchasing a moped where the only thing you see wrong is a dirty carburetor.<br /><br />My personal experience???&nbsp; If I were shopping for a moped, I would first decide if I&#39;m looking for a ride that is or can be made to look like new, or if I&#39;m looking for one that just works.&nbsp; Not all of us can be a Jimmy and find a new 1977 moped for cheap, so the second choice would be best.&nbsp; If the first choice is your goal, plan on taking a fair moped and making it look like new over time.<br /><br />Next, you might look at the rust situation, both outside and especially inside the gas tank.&nbsp; The outside rust that has pitted the chrome on a moped will never look great.&nbsp; Rust in a gas tank will have you &quot;jumping through hoops&quot; to clean or treat the gas tank or will have you cleaning the carburetor on the side of Grand Avenue during rush hour.<br /><br />Next, I would look at how common a moped is.&nbsp; Finding parts for some brands is not easy.&nbsp; For a first moped, try to pick a common brand (Puch) or a brand with a common engine (Puch-powered).&nbsp; There are other brands where parts are available as well.&nbsp; Even befoe you buy, go shopping for parts and write down the brands you would consider because lots of parts are out there.<br /><br />Finally, I would suggest you not try to get every last ounce of performance out of your moped unless you can allow for a lot of &quot;down time&quot; or unless it&#39;s a second moped in your fleet.&nbsp; From what I see, the more you soup up a moped, the more it breaks.<br /><br />Good luck shopping,<br />Dave Gibbons

					Brian,<br /><br />When you check plug color, look at the porcelian below the contacts.&nbsp; Don&#39;t worry about the metal around the outer edge or the contacts themselves.&nbsp; The porcelain gets hottest when the engine runs and that&#39;s when the color is developed.&nbsp; <br /><br />You might have heard of different &quot;heat range&quot; of plugs.&nbsp; A hotter plug just has a longer porcelain.&nbsp; It goes up higher into the metal around the outside of the plug (inside the threads) before it is bonded to the metal.&nbsp; That means it cannot dump its heat as easily as one that contacts the outside metal just barely inside the threaded metal.&nbsp; So it&#39;s the porcelain that develops the most heat and can burn to the proper color.&nbsp; <br /><br />I see your thoughts on the oil in the gasoline causing a darker tint to the porcelain color.&nbsp; The article is talking about motorcycles.&nbsp; Some do and some don&#39;t burn oil with the gasoline, but I think the article is talking about big bikes that don&#39;t burn oil with the gas so I assume they would have a lighter color.&nbsp; The oil does cause oily deposits on the metal at the end of the threads for sure and could be darkening the porcelain as well.<br /><br />Dave

					Brian,<br /><br />I just re-read your post.&nbsp; You said you have a Dellorto 14mm carb.&nbsp; I think you need to re-post on mopedarmy and ask if this is a normal size and brand carb for a Tomos A3.&nbsp; The Tomos I had (and sold) had a different brand of carb.&nbsp; I had the one in the service manual I gave to you.&nbsp; It&#39;s pictured on page 22.&nbsp; I do not have a record of what size mine was, but I wonder if it was as big as 14mm.<br /><br />I say this because my Vespa has a 12mm carb and I think 12mm is the original size for a Puch (which has a Bing carburetor).&nbsp; Mike would know for sure.&nbsp; Anyway, your Dellarto seems big to me.&nbsp; Post a question on the repair section of mopedarmy asking anyone else with a dellarto carb what size it is.&nbsp; Or email Mike at mijunkin@gmail.com.&nbsp; If you are posting on MopedArmy, first, see if you can read the numbers without disassembling the moped.&nbsp; People are not going to drop their engine to tell you their carb size.&nbsp; Tell them in the post where the numbers are that you want to read.&nbsp; If the engine must be dropped to read them, you have to hope people already read them and know what they have.&nbsp; Be sure to specify that you need people with the Dellarto carb.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know where the cutoff is between a Tomos A3 and a Tomos A35 and I don&#39;t know the differences between the two.&nbsp; You could research that by looking at the pictures of Tomos mopeds at mopedarmy.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;m all wrong and yours is an A35.&nbsp; Is the carb the difference?&nbsp; I don&#39;t know.&nbsp; I only know mine had that different brand of carb that&#39;s on page 22.&nbsp; If no one reports having a Dellarto carb, then, someone installed a different brand carb on YOUR moped.&nbsp; Maybe the first step is to see if you can slip on a smaller carb.&nbsp; Some mopedders in our group might have a smaller Dellarto, since they obviously fit.&nbsp; That might be worth a try.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dave<br /><br />

					I found an article about motorcycle carburetor tuning and I would like us to put our heads together and see if we can apply the information to simpler moped carburetors.&nbsp; I will first give you a link of where the article is, so you can read it yourself.&nbsp; Then, I want to summarize key points that I&#39;m hoping we can apply to moped carburetors that do not have all the adjustments a motorcycle carburetor has.&nbsp; The article is at:<br /><a href="//www.johnsmotorcycleparts.com/Keihin_CV_tuning_tips.htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">//www.johnsmotorcycleparts.com/Keihin_CV_tuning_tips.htm</a><br /><br />What interests me from the article is the idea we should do multiple plug chops to see where our carburetor problem is.&nbsp; AND we should always use NEW sparkplugs.&nbsp; The article says motorcycle carburetors have 1.) idle circuits 2.) midrange circuits and 3.) high speed circuits.&nbsp; I know most of our moped carburetors have the midrange and high circuits, but I have not figured out the idle circuits form mine yet.<br /><br />The midrange circuit is the needle attached to the throttle slide.&nbsp; The size, shape and position (up and down) of the needle gives us proper medium speed cruising.&nbsp; The main jet controls fuel flow at wide open throttle (WOT).<br /><br />The article tells us to do a plug chop by putting in a new plug, run the motorcycle at the range (right now, I&#39;ll say medium speed or WOT) and kill the engine and inspect the plug.&nbsp; The article explains that we will no longer see the tan color we all see in the books about mopeds.&nbsp; Leaded gasoline gave that tan color, and we don&#39;t have lead in the gasoline any more.&nbsp; NOW WE NEED EGGSHELL WHITE!&nbsp; We look at the ceramic surface below the spark gap and nothing else.&nbsp; So, for example, we would put in a new plug, run the moped for a mile or two at mid-throttle, kill the engine and inspect the plug.&nbsp; Then, we would find an open area, PUT IN A NEW PLUG and run the moped at WOT for a mile or two.&nbsp; Again, we would kill the engine and do an inspection of the plug color.<br /><br />Then, we need to figure out what our carburetor &quot;idle circuit&quot; is and do a third plug chop (with another new plug) with the engine idling.&nbsp; Actually, the article implies this is the first plug chop, but you get the idea.<br /><br />Interesting stuff!&nbsp; Can we apply it to mopeds?<br /><br />Dave

					Brian,<br /><br />I have been thinking about your problem and would like you to try something I saw at a moped/citizenship/music/fun/outing/ride/meet scooterists BBQ this weekend.&nbsp; Close off your intake by half.&nbsp; Mike suggested taping half of the air coming into the carb for a Chinese scooter at the BBQ because he KNEW it made it (the PopCycle) perform better.&nbsp; You need to try this.&nbsp; You can duct tape over half of your screen filter or maybe put a half-circle of cardboard on the side of the screen filter AWAY from the carb (so it does not get sucked into the carb.&nbsp; In fact, put the duct tape on the side away from the engine.<br /><br />Next, read an article I will post as a new thread here in the repair forum.&nbsp; I&#39;ll title it &quot;Carb Tuning&quot; but I think we need to figure out how it applies to your problem.&nbsp; This is especially true if taping half the intake helps.&nbsp; The article is about tuning motorcycle carburetors, and mopeds do not have nearly as many adjustments.&nbsp; We need to put together the idea that taping helps with the&nbsp; article and see if we can apply the motorcycle technology to simpler moped carburetors.&nbsp; It could be multiple plug chops will help us understand your problem.&nbsp; Read the posting and you will see what I mean.<br /><br />I don&#39;t have a solution yet, but if we put our heads together with the facts in the article, we might figure out something that will help mopeds.<br /><br />Dave

					A front page article in today&#39;s (June 30th) Post Dispatch reports that &quot;Dirty engines from China (are) a problem in U.S.&quot;<br /><br />It seems anyone can order a shipping container full of gasoline powered equipment, from generators to mopeds and those engines are polluting the air more than engines produced in the U.S. with government specifications on exhaust emissions.&nbsp; How much more?&nbsp; The article quotes one sale of 200,000 chain saws that will pump out 268 tons of carbon emissions over the lifetime of those chainsaws.<br /><br />In the future, the EPA might try to track those chainsaws (and generators and Chinese mopeds) to their current owners to get them removed from service and help reduce the smog problems in some cities.&nbsp; Can anyone say &quot;PopCycle?&quot;<br /><br />Next they might try attacking mopeds created before smog emissions were of interest.&nbsp; Lawn mowers are already of interest.&nbsp; An Internet search for &quot;emissions from lawn mowers&quot; found the sentence &quot;One old gas powered lawn mower running for an hour emits as much pollution as driving 650 miles in a 1992 model automobile.&quot;&nbsp; Today&#39;s article reports lawn mowers and other small engine equipment might soon be required to have catalytic converters to reduce emissions.&nbsp; That won&#39;t make them cheaper to buy.<br /><br />Well, I need to stop writing this.&nbsp; I gotta&#39; go fire up my weed eater and my lawn mower and cut and trim the grass.&nbsp; Oh, and I have been meaning to do a test run of my backup generator.&nbsp; Put on your gas masks!!!!<br /><br />Dave

					Have you changed to premium fuel?&nbsp; I wonder what the end result compression ratio is.&nbsp; &nbsp;When an engine exceeds a certain compression ratio, you need to upgrade the fuel to premium or you can have pre-ignition or &quot;engine knock.&quot;&nbsp; I always thought of 9.5:1 as requiring regular gas (what&#39;s that? 97 octane?) and 10.5:1 as needing premium, but I don&#39;t know the cutoff between those two.<br /><br />Did the high-compression head say what the compression ratio would end up having?&nbsp; I wonder how one would figure it.&nbsp; <br /><br />First, you can figure displacement mathematically with the cylinder dimensions of bore and stroke.&nbsp; Or you could figure it by connecting a hose to the spark plug hole and run that hose to a graduated (measurement markings on the side) glass container held upside down under water.&nbsp; Then, you would run the piston from bottom dead center to top dead center and measure the air pumped into the glass.&nbsp; But that does not take into account the space above the piston in the head.<br /><br />Second, I wonder how accurate a measurement you would get of just the head by removing it, holding it upside down and filling it with water.&nbsp; Then dump out and measure the water.&nbsp; You would then need to determine if the piston makes it all the way to the top of the cylinder.&nbsp; If not, you must add the volume of the space from the top of the stroke to the bottom of the head.&nbsp; <br /><br />The true compression ratio would be the total volume from the first measurement plus the second compared to the second only.&nbsp; You would call the second measurement &quot;one&quot; and see how many times the second measurement goes into the first.&nbsp; <br />
