				Part of me looks at the weather forecast which says &quot;thunderstorms likely&quot; for tomorrow and says, &quot;Maybe we shouldn&#39;t.&quot;<br /><br />But then again, the forecast says thunderstorms likely or possible for EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE NEXT 5 DAYS. <br /><br />So yeah. Maybe? I&#39;ve got some stuff I need to get done before/after work tomorrow, but if i get it done, I&#39;m probably down to ride.

				Well I rode around Lawrence last night but we decided to change it to Scooter Thursday since it was just me and Sarah C. Her Venice 50 is quicker off the line since my C70 seems to have decided to have neutral and 3&#39;rd for gears but the Honda has a higher top end. We rolled around the K.U. campus, cruised downtown, then raced across the dam at Clinton Lake to watch the sunset. The bugstorm was kind of weird going back across the dam but no sign of the blowing sand that kept everyone else from riding.
