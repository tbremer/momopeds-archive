				1977 used their shop for a porno shoot, and it was a disgusting one at that.<br /><br />They are expensive and slower on shipping than treats.

				They&#39;ve got about a 75% dismal failure rate with me.&nbsp; The only way I&#39;ve gotten them to correct their wrongs is by calling them out on MA, getting attacked by members, and finally getting the owner to call me after I bash them in a public forum.&nbsp; They don&#39;t respond to e-mail as a policy, not like they say they will and just don&#39;t, they don&#39;t even try - unacceptable for an online business IMHO.&nbsp; Shipping is slow, and they&#39;re more expensive than treats.<br /><br />So, I don&#39;t order from them anymore, and encourage others not to as well.&nbsp; But some IRE members have been lucky, or maybe it&#39;s just me being unlucky.

				1977 used to be a lot more expensive than treats, but it seems like their prices have become more competitive recently. I&#39;ve had good and bad shipping experiences with them, although I would hope that if you were paying them $1000 or whatever for a new moped, they would make sure that they shipped it quickly and all that. I always look to treats first, but if they&#39;re out, I&#39;m not opposed to buying from 1977.

				I have only placed two orders with 1977, seals and a gasket set. They got here in about 5 days so I can&#39;t say I have had a bad experience but, when treats mistakenly sent me a Puch 50cc hi-hi head instead of the head gasket I ordered. I sent one e-mail offering to return the head and ended up it took less than an hour for the response. Ended up with a 2-day expressed treats grab bag with the head gasket some other stuff and a free hi-hi head. I&#39;ll stick with treats if at all possible....

				Oh...but the real question, regardless of 1977mopeds....<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t buy that thing.&nbsp; It&#39;s too expensive, and most likely real cheaply made.&nbsp; I worked at a chinese scooter shop for a while, and really don&#39;t trust anything imported from there.&nbsp; They make the engines from <em>powdered metal</em>.&nbsp; Yes, they put powdered aluminum in a press rather than pouring molten material into a mold.&nbsp; This is why the stuff breaks <strong>all the time</strong>.&nbsp; On top of that there&#39;s the cheap electronics, the fact that it&#39;s 4 stroke, the impossibility of tuning the thing to be faster...&nbsp; Blech

				I appreciate the you all!&nbsp; : )<br /><br />I am looking to buy my son a moped that he can have for a long time... I did not know that metro rider was chineese!&nbsp; Thanks for the warning!!&nbsp; <br /><br />The other thing I am looking at is the tomos revival moped. at heaters.. but I was hoping not to spend that much money.<br /><br />Treats has been real good to us too, I wish they sold complete mopeds!&nbsp; Or do they???&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Maybe you could look into importing a Pug from Canada? Or Contact Motobrokane on MA, he&#39;s seemed to have some luck with getting new peds from Canada.<br /><br />Also, a well re-built / stockish E50 should last as long as any brand new moped, and be cheaper than a new Tomos!
