				In case you all hadn&#39;t noticed, it&#39;s cold outside. It&#39;s snowing AGAIN, and the forecast won&#39;t really get above 20 in the foreseeable future (the high will actually be 7 one day, according to the forecast I&#39;m looking at). Well you know what? I&#39;m sick of this. Fuck you, winter. Fuck you and your cold temperatures, and your ceaseless snow, and your everlasting ice, and your sunless gray sky.<br /><br />To tell winter all of this in person, I want to ride. Does anyone else want to join me in biting their thumb and flipping the bird at winter? I have no doubt it will be a short ride, but I want to make this statement to winter, and the more people who come along, the better. Also, to appeal to your logical sides, it might be good practice for Denver, and it would be an opportunity to try out winter riding gear. Yeah?<br /><br />So who&#39;s in? <br /><br />(I&#39;m figuring on planning this for after the roads have dried from the currently falling snow.)

				I&#39;m in but I gots to get some wheels, the lucas transmission overhaul-in-a-can got me a whole 1 mph in forward motion but it may have to soak in. It feels like a stick in molasses when I shift into drive. I&#39;m going to try and borrow a truck tomorrow.

				Its the never ending ice/snow/freeze storm. Why didn&#39;t I leave when I had the chance? When I was gazing at the beautiful wide open vista of the Kansas prairie, thinking of how it must have looked to my Grandfather and the deep family roots, why didn&#39;t I see it all covered in a foot of icy slushy shit with another foot of drifting snow on top. Car killing cold misery, cabin fever homicidal rage, and that&#39;s on the good days of January. This too shall soon pass...
