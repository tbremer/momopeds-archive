				Yo,<br /><br />&nbsp; Yes I live under a rock, a very secret rock with nooks and crannys, not unlike a japaneese garden with american fast food wrappers everywhere, pissing me off. But when I can escape this area, I like to go ride my moped. Rideing my moped makes me realize there is nothing better to do, but ride my moped, when there is something else to do... know what I mean...<br /><br />At any rate if you followed this so far then maybe you ll want to ride with this fool during the week, not just SUN, Id like to ride like to Forest park, book around there, or carondolet park and do the same, there is also francis park, then we could go to ted drews....<br />At any rate, I putting this out there...if anyone wants to ride tomorrow late afternoon, whatever that means, I guess like 6ish...and ride to just ride for the sake of riding with someone...Im down...<br /><br />The weather is just so hospitible lately! wont last for long, perfect weather for a ride<br /><br />Jimmy
