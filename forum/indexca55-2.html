				Daryl, we broke into your basement last night and fixed Ashford&#39;s Moby.&nbsp; The timing was set to .5 and its now set to 1.5ish.&nbsp; &nbsp;I brought the incorrect base for the timing tool so I got it as close as I could.&nbsp; I can recheck it once you fix some other issues.&nbsp; You were running an incorrect plug / boot combo so it was not making consistent connection.&nbsp; We stole gas from her other ped and tried to fire up the moby but then realized that the carb was shimmed with a hefty bag and had air leaks to the power of a billion.&nbsp; Get the proper intake and it should work.

				i shimmed it. and it wasn&#39;t a hefty bag.&nbsp; it was a piece of inner tube. get your shit straight sucka (and it was really hard to get it to set in there correctly so if you fucked it up without putting it back i shan&#39;t be very happy).<br /><br />aaaaand, when you are referring to jank work on MY bikes you can go ahead and direct that to ME as I am the one who would have done it.&nbsp; <br /><br />thanks.

				@ Daryl, we tried calling and texting you but you didn&#39;t ever respond.&nbsp; You had asked me to bring the tools to fix the bike so I figured it would be ok.&nbsp; <br /><br />@ Ash, I didn&#39;t put the inner tube shim back in because gas would eat it and gum up everything. The correct solution would be a different intake.&nbsp; What size is that carb, I might have a moby intake that could work.&nbsp; <br /><br />By the way, I hadn&#39;t checked out the moby before now.&nbsp; Pretty nice bike.&nbsp; If you want some help getting it going Lets plan on next weekend.&nbsp;
