				I haven&#039;t calculated the exact mileage or route.&nbsp; Doke said something about camping at his mother&#039;s place.&nbsp; Overnighting sounds like our best and safest bet.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even like driving that big ass Lincoln home after Chilifest. Besides, it may be the last chance of the season to fill my tent with bean and beer farts.

				Weather looks great. If I can&#039;t get my Vespa running on Friday I&#039;ll have to take the scooter, but I&#039;m still down to ride. It&#039;s a long-ass ride though, probably 2 hours. <br />We could just take the van. Van sleeps around 5. My big tent sleeps like 12, but takes a while to set up.

				This is SO lame...but we could ride to the winery, have someone meet us with the van, throw the peds in the van, then drive across the river and get dropped off at the first exit.<br /><br />Anyone have a boat that can pick us up and take us across the river? :)

				Meet at 11, Leave by 12?<br /><br />We need someone to drive the van* (or at least a car with camping stuff in it) or we&#039;re not going to have any place to sleep. If people want to ride, I don&#039;t mind following in the van; the Vespa&#039;s not running. (My Honda Elite is, obviously.)<br /><br /><br />* Whoever it is can just drive straight there, I don&#039;t mean following us.

				I assume we&#039;re looking at something like this...<br /><br />US-40 W&nbsp; &nbsp; 54.7 mi,&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 hour 28 mins&nbsp; &nbsp;[Google est. by car]<br />//goo.gl/maps/StoQn<br /><br />Hwy 87 is also an option but it looks like it probably runs faster than Hwy 179.
