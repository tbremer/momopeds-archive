				Anyone ever wonder what happens to peds sold to people not active on this forum or MA.<br />I have sold a variated (polini variator and mallossi belt, ciao w/ sidecovers,turn signals,and a basket, a moby 7 w/ a 16.16 and some sweet extra parts, a pug 102 with a 16.16, hi-comp head, and a polini top one pipe.&nbsp; Definetly not moped folks, explained that they probably would never enjoy the bike unless they learned to make repairs.... Havent seen any of them pop back up, so I am guessing they are gathering dust-sort of sad, I would love to score any of these bikes back again.<br />Should have taken all the ciao variated stuff-the girl who bought it looked at me uniterested when I showed off this feature and attempted to explain it, but really liked the pretty basket.

				I have hoped they would popup on cl advertised as a scooter or incorrectly spelled for super cheap.&nbsp; Afraid the 7 may be ridden as a dirt bike by a 9 year old.

				It seems they eventually make it back in to the hands of moped folks.&nbsp; I used to hate selling them to people that were looking for a moped only for the great mileage.&nbsp; Absolutely the worst buyer you could get.&nbsp; It was those buyers that made me wish I hadn&#39;t regreased the wheel bearings, replaced the rusty chain, etc.

				I always love Bryan&#39;s Craigslist ads. <br /><br />Not only do you put in a disclaimer about how it&#39;s old and don&#39;t buy it if you aren&#39;t prepared for things to break, there&#39;s also the &quot;No, I will not trade this for your X-box, the 4-wheeler your drunk uncle wrecked, the timeshare you have at that lake in North Dakota, or your rock collection&quot; line.
