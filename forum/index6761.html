					I have a few things I am looking to get rid of. Cody and I are planning to come down again. I can bring anything that I have with me. Feel free to post what you have for sale or trade or if you are looking to buy something.<br /><br />Here are a couple of things for starters:<br /><br />I have this 1977 Solex. I know that it is rough but I believe it is complete, minus some broken cables and needing someone to show it some love. The previous owner put a new top end on it back in the 80&#39;s sometime and it has never been started since. It has no spark but the engine turns over smoothly. The bike is also a 3800 and not a 5000. The parts missing off of the engine are in a bag zip tied to the bike, I removed the parts. <br /><br />I paid $200 for it and that is how much I need for it. That is my bottom dollar on it.<br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/For%20sale/s234001.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/For%20sale/s234005.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/For%20sale/s234003-1.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/For%20sale/s234004-1.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/For%20sale/s234.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Bicycles. I got these out of a barn last year. All of them are projects in rough shape. I do not know if any of the tires hold air in them. They all need some kind of work or something.<br /><br />The purple one with the tank I rode around the driveway when I got it. It is spray painted purplish color. I cleaned the terminals up and both headlights worked on it last year. $45.00<br /><br />Green girls bike, the rims do not match, one is chrome and one is white. That is about all I know about it.&nbsp; $45.00<br /><br />The blue Schwinn Speedster, I know nothing about it as well. The front head badge is missing.&nbsp; $35.00<br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/For%20sale/s234006.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/For%20sale/s234007.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Any questions feel free to ask. -Rob<br /><br />

					I am going to be in St. Louis for a couple of days next week. I have never been there before. I am looking for suggestions on things to do while there. I am told that the Zoo is awesome, and there are attractions like the brewery but what else is there? Are there any places that a gear head like myself should be checking out if I have some free alone time?

I have checked the resistor in the tail light and it is good, both rear bulbs are good. The headlight does not light up while kicking, however the horn works. <br /><br />I have adjusted the points and everything seems as it should. The only way to get any spark is to flip the run switch on and off while kicking it over. The switch was cleaned and is working as it should.<br /><br />Is this a condenser issue? Any ideas? Is there a way to hardwire these?

					When I was putting my Maxi together I found out that even with a Magnum shaft my pedal arms still would not clear my pipe. I soon found out that I had the wrong pedal arms. <br /><br />My friend Cody had the right pedal arms since he had a ZA50 pedal shaft, so I gave him my Magnum pedal shaft for his build.<br /><br />I am not sure what my pedal arms came off of, they are pretty short and straight. I decided I wanted to use them anyways. Cody gave me his ZA50 pedal shaft out of his Maxi and I had my original E50 shaft. So here is what I did:<br /><br />I put the ZA50 shaft into the frame, and decided how much longer I wanted the shaft. I then cut that amount off of the stock Maxi shaft. Sorry no pictures.<br /><br />I&#39;m sorry I know not everybody has access to a lathe but I do so I used it. I chucked the stock E50 shaft in the lathe and made sure it was all square then started turning it down:<br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/2011-07-09_21-55-45_427.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />I turned it down till I had this nipple on the end of the E50 shaft:<br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/2011-07-09_22-04-41_595.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />I took the ZA50 shaft and pulled the red plastic fitting off of the end. I took the E50 shaft with the nipple on the end and tapped it firmly into the hole in the end of the ZA50 shaft.<br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/2011-07-09_22-22-09_773.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />When the nipple was made, the E50 shaft also had a beveled edge put in it to make some room for the weld. Here are the 2 shafts welded together:<br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/2011-07-09_22-31-12_42.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />After the 2 were welded together they were cleaned up some what smooth with a side grinder. I then put the shaft back into the Maxi frame:<br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/2011-07-09_22-37-09_280.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />I took some nice heavy duty pipe that just slides over the shaft and cut it to length for a spacer. I put the pedal arm back and it now easily clears my pipe:<br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/2011-07-10_00-21-53_236.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><br />With my pedal arms being flat they would not clear the ZA50 so I cut the ZA50 shaft off on that side fairly close to the sprocket. I then took a piece of heavy duty pipe and figured out how much room I needed then just welded it all back up a little further out:<br /><br /><img src="../albums/y215/wrenchdoozer/2011-07-10_00-43-03_32.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />It all seems to work pretty good so far.<br /><br />

					I always loved the Express SR&#39;s, when this one came up for auction I decided I had to have it. I know it isnt all the way complete but it seemed good for a donor to have if I ever come across another one or something. If its complete enough I may just fix it anyways cause I think its cool.<br /><br />So anyways here it is, I got this Express SR and an Urban Express for one money. I believe I got a good deal, what do you guys think?<br /><br />They are about an hour and a half from here, I talked to the owner already. Paid him with Paypal and I pick them up today.<br /><br /><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;_rdc=1&amp;item=320532876953&amp;ru=http://shop.ebay.com:80/%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp3907.m570.l1313%26_nkw%3D320532876953%26_sacat%3DSee-All-Categories%26_fvi%3D1&amp;viewitem=#ht_500wt_975" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;_rdc=1&amp;item=320532876953&amp;ru=http://shop.ebay.com:80/%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp3907.m570.l1313%26_nkw%3D320532876953%26_sacat%3DSee-All-Categories%26_fvi%3D1&amp;viewitem=#ht_500wt_975</a>

					I am in need of a pedal shaft for my Maxi. I removed the E50 and put a ZA50 in there. I am unsure if the Magnum shaft is longer than a standard ZA50 one or not. Maybe someone can chime in and tell me?<br /><br />All I know is my E50 one will not work and I want a long one to clear my pipe. I would be interested in the pedal shaft, and cranks if they are straight.<br /><br />The parts would need to be shipped to 61270,IL. I would like to use Paypal.<br /><br />Thanks- Rob<br />

					I am sure there have been a few of you on here that have been wondering who I am so I thought I would do a little introduction or what not.<br /><br />My name is Rob, I live in Morrison,IL almost right on the Iowa/IL border. I&#39;m 34, married and have a baby girl due here June 30th.<br /><br />I have met a few of you in person already. I was at Peddy Cash&#39;s rally in Chicago last year. I stayed at the Heart O Chicago hotel with some friends and IRE* was staying there also. I was the tall guy with the mo-hawk and we were the ones with the Honda Elite&#39;s. <br /><br />I met a lot of cool people from IRE* while we stayed there and even though we were frowned on some because we were on scooters by a few people we still had a blast!<br /><br />My friends and I went out to eat with Rick and some guys at White Castle and Rick bought us some burgers, a female member of IRE* loaned us a lock and chain for the night (Sorry I forgot your name). Mark told me the whole story about being shot. <br /><br />Everyone in IRE* was really good to us and it was appreciated. Thanks for letting us join in on some good times with you guys. I met a lot of really good people that weekend.<br /><br />When I was in high school I had a Peugeot 103 with a long seat on it and have found memories of riding it everywhere. It was sold at a garage sale because my parents wanted it out of the garage after I broke a ring and had no idea where to get another one (And I was broke). I hoped the next person would of done something good with it, it was sold for like $25bucks. I saw it about 4 years later in a police impound lot and not long after that it was gone. I never saw it again.<br /><br />I also had a few expresses,6 wheelers,go carts, stuff like that growing up. While in Chicago at the rally I bought a Maxi because the moped bug was really kicking in.<br /><br />So I have been on these forums lurking for awhile. I have learned a lot here. I have PM&#39;d a few people on here over the year and have had a lot of support and answers to questions I have. <br /><br />Mark,Tom, MikeB, thanks for all the help I have received from you guys! I know sometimes some of my questions may seem dumb but the help is appreciated.<br /><br />Here is a picture of my Maxi right after I got her home from Chicago:<br /><br /><img src="../hs149.snc1/5532_112059958701_507143701_2271161_2524005_n.html" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />I will post a more current picture of it when I am on my other PC. I am putting a ZA50 in it with a 60cc Athena with a Dellorto 19mm clone. <br /><br />I am planning on being at a few rallys this year and I will look forward to seeing friends I have made and meeting other cool people.<br /><br />-Rob<br /><br /><br />* I say IRE even though I mean IRE/BreakfastMafia/Mid-Mo/ColdTrailers, because I am unsure exactly who is with what group.
