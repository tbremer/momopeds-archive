			<strong>Harrison Fraud</strong>:
			<br />
			last weekend a few friends and I, while spending a few days in KC, decided it would be a cool idea to &quot;urban hike&quot; around the train tracks by the river. So we spent 7 hours hiking and exploring random abandoned buildings that were flooded out in 93. We found some cool stuff, check it!<br /><br />

			if you can find the steel box thing they are in, you could grab them. They are in decent shape for sitting out in the elements for ages. Mostly Yamaha and Suzuki. There was a rad kawasaki 3 cylinder 2 stroke in the back. Wish I had the truck to pull them all out with<br />
