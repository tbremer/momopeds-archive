				Bright lives around Lawn and Pernod.&nbsp; Somewhat south of Arsenal and Kingshighway.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You can&#39;t possible miss the bike he&#39;d be riding.&nbsp; &nbsp;Looks like a John Deere tractor.&nbsp; It *was* a blue Vespa bravo needing significant sanding and priming when I gave it to him... now it&#39;s some kind of sparkling redneck lawn-tractor colored thing.&nbsp; A monument to lots of money dumped into a dubious project.&nbsp; <br /><br />
