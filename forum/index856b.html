			Weather was nice today, got the peds and Harley all spread out. Timed the cams on the Sportster which is something like a 6 dial version of Tetris, move one and all the others change. Then before I put the gasket on, I run inside to trace it, so I can make another one in the future. Come outside and its raining, crap I hate Kansas weather sometimes.

			What an awesome day! Rode some new roads in Lawrence, mega twisties and an insane gravel road hill climb. Too much fun!
