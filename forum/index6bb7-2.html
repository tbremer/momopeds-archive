				Oh, and the divisions. We, as a group, will let pretty much anyone come ride with us.<br />&nbsp;Moped = motor &amp; pedals.<br />Noped = small decplacement, 50ccs, bike style frame, pegs.<br />Scooter = floor board, lots of fairings, you&#39;ll get made fun of, espcially if its chinese, though we&#39;ve all been there, i think. And its all in good fun.<br /><br />Seriously though, if it&#39;s two-wheeled, and barley functions we&#39;d love it.

				Barely functions is the key.&nbsp; No one likes the people with them fancy bikes that can stay running for more than 2 trips without tinkering.&nbsp; Except Dave.&nbsp; We all love Dave because he has detailed knowledge of magic, nuclear missiles, anything that uses electricity, and engines, of course.&nbsp; Things that stump 8 of us for weeks Dave can fix in 30 seconds.<br /><br />Like last night, when he got Annie&#39;s express headlight working after me, Annie, and Mark tried for like 3 days straight and failed at every juncture.&nbsp; Dave wiggled his magical fingers, and a lightning bolt flew in from the clear blue sky.&nbsp; We thought the express would be fried, but when we checked, the lightning had perfectly soldered the right wires together and the headlight worked once more.&nbsp; Then he whistled a tune and squirrels, rabbits, and small birds found all the right screws to put the headlight bucket back together.&nbsp; Then Dave pronounced that his work was complete.&nbsp; He threw down a smoke bomb and disappeared.&nbsp; Though we could hear the zipping of a 2-stroke in the distance...&nbsp; Amazing.
