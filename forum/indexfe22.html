				<em>Friday Friday Friday</em><br /><br />Here&#039;s the driving plan I&#039;m working on now:<br /><strong>THU night or FRI a.m.:</strong> People who can&#039;t go with the van leave their bikes at the shop.<br /><strong>THU or FRI:</strong> Have RK or Holmes get us a trailer* <br /><strong>FRI around 11 a.m.:</strong> Meet at shop, put all the bikes on the trailer <br /><strong>FRI noon:</strong> The van leaves for the rally with the first wave<br /><strong>FRI/SAT:</strong> Everybody else drives to StL and figures their own shit out<br /><strong>SUN:</strong> Wake up, throw up, drive back<br /><br />* If not enough people are going we can remove the back seat and fit like 4-5 mopeds in the back. Depends on how much other stuff we are taking, like coolers and gas tanks and bags and shit.<br />Actually I have a cargo rack so maybe 6 mopeds.

				5 people or less, we can sleep in the van if you want. 6 or more we need to get a room, but it will only be $10 each or something, so that&#039;s cool.<br /><br />Is there an empty building there or something? I&#039;m not sure how we&#039;re supposed to camp in downtown StL. Bring a sleeping bag and a gun, I guess.

				If we get a trailer, we can take 7 in the van. <br /><br />Current roll call: Jeremy, Jesse, Doke, Beke, Porter, Nash<br /><br />I have a little tent I can bring, it sleeps 2. I have a big tent that sleeps like 12 but it requires stakes.<br />Make sure when we camp that we get something in East shade so we don&#039;t bake at 8 am.<br /><br />Or just ask Matt to get us a room. Gas will be about $10 each (sorry, it gets shitty mpg).

				Right on, I can definitely haul people if you want to carry mopeds.&nbsp; I can fit 4 others besides myself in my car.&nbsp; <br /><br />I could fit a bike in the back with 4 people if it was taken apart.&nbsp; Like a hobbit with a subframe that&#039;s removable.
