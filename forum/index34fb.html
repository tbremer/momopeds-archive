				Depends if its something like a jawa or some other crappy brand, my mopeds wont allow it in the garage. I&#39;ll offer to help, I&#39;d just have to figure out how to get it to STL.

				I&#39;m sure you could ship it to my house in Lawrence if you wanted. My Dad has a whole half garage with nothing in it besides assorted junk and my stupid Tomos, and I&#39;m sure the Tomos wouldn&#39;t mind some company since I&#39;ve been neglecting it. Also, if it makes a difference on shipping charges, that&#39;d be a little closer to Denver than KC (like... 50 miles or something? I dunno, I measure distance in minutes, not miles). <br /><br />And yeah, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s room somewhere for us to bring it to MLC for you.

				Yeah, I&#39;ll shoot you my address. I&#39;m always going over to KC anyway, so I could drop it off somewhere over there right before you come so you wouldn&#39;t have to come out to Lawrence. Kevin, would your mopeds be okay with having an extra Pinto frame lying around for a little while? Maybe it could keep your Swinger frame company...

				You know, I bet you could legally argue that most of those peds do belong to you. You know, like, if you had been charging storage fees for them, the fees would probably be into the hundreds or thousands of dollars, right? So since most people wouldn&#39;t pay that much to get their moped out of Chuck&#39;s Basement Storage, you could just like.... repossess them or something. Auction them off to yourself. Bring down the hand of invented laws on the situation!

				I&#39;d be down to have another pinto/swinger frame. If its in really nice shape maybe it will set an example for my Swinger, lookin all pretty and stuff. If Beth comes <br /><br />Chuck, what is YOURS in your basement. I still want that Orange Ciao... it would go great with my other orange Italian peds... tell whoever it is that own it that I want it...I want to fix it and ride it. I can bring some cash over and check out which ones you wanna get rid of. You need Hobbit parts.... what are you trying to do, be all fast or something?<br /><br />PS: You should sell/trade Mark... he told me he wants a hobbit, just not a yellow one.<br /><br />Myself and my buddy Scott are planning on taking his truck to STL for MLC, its got a closed bed, I bet at least 3 peds and some parts will fit.<br />

				Whatever you say Chuck, you can keep the ciao locked up down there forever, hopefully whosever it is, picks it up before Zen kicks it out of his new room.<br /><br />Dont you have 2 hobbits? I just know Mark was wanting a red one, and probably would trade cool stuff for it.<br /><br />In all honesty I dont really want any of your peds. I&#39;ve done a great job collecting my fair share of ped, maybe someone else will want one, and actually ride it. I was just gonna make whatever peds you had for sale, road worthy again... and get some more people on mopeds. I dont wanna have more mopeds, I just wanna hang with more moped people.
