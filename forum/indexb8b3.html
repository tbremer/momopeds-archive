				I have noticed that many are becoming aware of the many usurpations of our liberties that are becoming more obvious each day. Be advised that an opportunity exists to make a difference. The recent presidential preference primary was just that no delegates were awarded. Know that Missouri will be holding caucuses on St Patrick&#39;s day. It is your opportunity to help carry the message of liberty throughout the land. Bring home our troops. End unnecessary Federal control and spending. Bring our troops home. Stop SOPA, NDAA and other unconstitutional power grabs. Be a RON PAUL DELEGATE in your local caucus in Missouri on Mar 17.

				In a nutshell, Ron Paul wants the Federal Government to stay out of our lives. Even though he believes in the right to life, he doesn?t want to force his belief on you- hence what every other politician wants. That is why he wants to overturn Roe v Wade, so that each state can do what they people vote on-States Rights. Consistently, Ron Paul says the same thing with regard to the drug laws. He feels the States should regulate it like we already do with alcohol. Just because a president is pro choice, or pro life, shouldn?t have an effect on everyone, because the president isn?t supposed to be a King. If you believe in that, than you are equally oppressive, pushing your values or what is important to you on a person who might be religiously opposed.<br />There is a deep misunderstanding of our Constitution in this country. This could be why there was a Civil Rights Act in the first place. If they just adhered to the Right to Private Property Act in 1787(I believe that is the 14th Amendment), minorities wouldn?t have needed the Civil Rights Act. We should have re-elected members of congress and changed a few judges and they would enforce the existing law that blacks are entitled to the same rights and property because that is their human right! Ron Paul deplored Jim Crow Laws, stating we are all better off without them. He voted Yes on MLK day to replace another paid Federal holiday, because he actually is one of his heroes. Check all of his Congressional Record, not just part of it. He admired MLK?s strength to stand up and demonstrate Civil Disobedience to an oppressive government. He sees the injustices in the legal system with regard to non-violent drug crimes and how it has jailed many of the blacks, doing more harm than good to their communities and families. This is why he would pardon all non-violent drug criminals and fix what now world-wide drug cartel is. He loves freedom, not just for white people! His position is that he has no right to determine who deserves freedom as per the Constitution that says it is your human birthright! He wants you to work at whatever your wage is, but keep all of it! He feels that they are the fruits of your labor the Government has no right to take it. What better way to help the poor and the minority? I don?t know a better liberal Democrat for Civil Rights, or a more Conservative Republican with sound Economic solutions. I don?t know a more Liberal Democrat is for peace and harmony as Ron Paul. Anyone who can attempt to say otherwise is merely lying. Perhaps they don?t care to see the truth and prefer to continue the lie that has become the bedrock of our crumbling free society.

This is in the northwest<br />corner of the intersection of Hwy 291 and Hwy 50 in Lee?s Summit.<br />&nbsp;<br />The caucus will still start precisely at 10:00 AM. BUT - Please still plan on arriving between 8:00 and<br />9:00, but no later than 9:00, as ?check in? will take considerable time.<br />&nbsp;

Fuck that shit, how about we just improve education and stop letting assholes ship jobs out of country? <br /><br />Our fucking liberty isn&#39;t under attack by the government, It&#39;s these corporate super-citizens we should be worried about.

				Ron Paul has two good ideas. Cut the military and end the pointless drug war. He is consistent. He is also consistently a cunt. I want single payer universal health care and free college education. I want this to be paid for by the rich and huge corporations that live off the backs of the common man. Am I a socialist? More or less. Is Ron Paul going to work in the exact opposite manner? Yes. Fuck Ron Paul in his life begins at conception ass. His newsletter was full of racist trash. His name was signed on it. If he didn&#39;t write it and didn&#39;t bother reading and approving every single issue put out with his name signed on it, maybe he lacks the proper focus to run the entire fucking country. Ron Paul is a cunt.

				Boo frekin hoo I want I want, I just want the killing to stop.&nbsp; Bitching about what you want over a pile of dead bodies.&nbsp; <br /><br />That racist shit is fucking played out, it was a newsletter written as the Ron Paul Newsletter, he didn&#39;t write it, he didn&#39;t sign it, he&#39;s not a racist, gets your facts straight.

				Hey, I want no war too. Isn&#39;t the things that you want the reason for voting? If its only about no war, you are put of luck, sad to say because nobody that is electable takes that position.<br /><br />The newsletter thing isn&#39;t about whether he is racist or not (he is anti civil rights, take that however you want) it is about how he would allow that shit to go out UNDER HIS NAME and not read every last word of it.

				Federal student loan interest rates are going up to 6.8%. I never understood the opposition to health care reform. They obviously have never waited the better part of a day in the ER behind people using it as primary care.
