				Cool site I.R.E.&nbsp; I like it!&nbsp; You do amazing stuff Mike.&nbsp; <br /><br />Are you going to put an asterisk on the I.R.E lettering on the home page to tell people what it stands for?<br /><br />I just got the neighbor&#39;s Sachs Foxi running.&nbsp; It bogs badly.&nbsp; The air cleaner is missing and I found restricting the air intake makes it run much better.&nbsp; This must be one of those mopeds that needs the slight restriction of an air filter.&nbsp; Right now, I bolted a piece of metal half-way across the carb intake to make it run well.&nbsp; Where do I buy an air filter for a square Bing?&nbsp; Anyone?<br />Signed: Old F4rt.

				Oh yeah, I suppose we should say what I.R.E. means somewhere...&nbsp; I&#39;ll fix that when I get a minute to play with the site more.&nbsp; Like I said, this isn&#39;t at all what it will look like in the end.&nbsp; Me, Kristin, Tom, and Ryne kinda just threw this all together Thursday night.&nbsp; Eventually the site will be amazing (and not 5 different styles and such like it is now), but it&#39;ll be a little bit before then.<br /><br />I think I might actually have a square bing air cleaner laying around in my basement.&nbsp; Is it like a longish rectangular plastic box with a metal snap thing that keeps the end on?&nbsp; I have a square bing that is disassembled and I think complete, and I think that&#39;s the airfilter to it.&nbsp; I&#39;ll have to check.<br /><br />I think I still have that switch you wanted too...I think.

				Mike,<br /><br />I don&#39;t know what the air filter looks like.&nbsp; I only have an open carb inlet with two screw holes on each side of the hole.&nbsp; No clamp-on filter would fit.&nbsp; If I cannot find one, I&#39;ll need to make a mount for a clamp-on filter.&nbsp; Old F4rt.

				Here&#39;s the air filter I&#39;m talking about.&nbsp; The air intake side of the square bing I&#39;ve got has 4 holes, and the filter has only 2.&nbsp; The inside of the filter is still there, but could use a good cleaning.<br /><br />I tried to do a google search to see what a square bing air filter looked like before I went all the way to the basement, because I&#39;m lazy, and they&#39;re isn&#39;t anything about them anywhere.&nbsp; Since I clearly have the only remaining square bing filter on planet earth, you can have it for the low cost of helping me with some timing and wiring issues when the time comes for my rigid.&nbsp; It&#39;s still gonna be a while.<br /><br />Also, I have the disassembled square bing itself if you&#39;re interested.&nbsp; It has a 52 jet, and supposedly they take different jets than regular bings, and are harder to come by.&nbsp; My camera died before I could snap a pic of that though...<br /><br />I&#39;ll bring it all tomorrow.

				Mike,<br /><br />Yes, only two holes are threaded on the carb itself, so the filter only needs two holes.&nbsp; As to helping with your rigid, you don&#39;t need to give me anything and I&#39;ll help.&nbsp; But I would appreciate trying the filter.&nbsp; If you have need for it, I would like to use it as a pattern to make one.&nbsp; See you tomorrow.
