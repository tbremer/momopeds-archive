				I was gonna ask if he was wearing a helmet. Always remember even if you dont think people will pull out, you have to expect it. About 30 mins ago some dude almost hit scott. People simply just dont pay attention unless you are in some sort of Semi-truck or something that can potentially fuck up their car if they pull out. <br /><br />Hopefully Tom&#39;s pretty mug only shows some battle scars... be careful and wear helmets. Now that we know Tom is relatively OK, do we have details on the ped. Its bad enough when people get fucked up, but peds too... makes me even more sad.
