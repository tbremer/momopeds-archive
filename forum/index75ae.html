				Coins, but not in any legit coin-collector sort of way -- I just trade out all the wheat pennies and really old nickles/dimes/quarters I find at work, because I think it&#39;s cool that there are still coins around from the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s. These things were around for the end of WWII. If coins could talk, you know? <br /><br />Piggy banks/miscellanous pig stuff (although really I need to downsize a little. I don&#39;t have anything like Cal&#39;s setup, and what&#39;s the point of having all the stuff if you can&#39;t display it?)<br /><br />Goofy/ridiculous earrings, which sadly I almost never wear. I got into the habit of wearing them in Costa Rica and got out of it as soon as I came back because I rode a lot when I came back, and giant earrings don&#39;t play nicely with full face helmets and wind. <br /><br />I also have a bit of a moped manual collection going on at this point, since I&#39;m still trying to scan them and put them online for people. I need go get back on that project...

				Don&#39;t use the heavy Edison Phone tone arm as they wore out the cylinders relatively fast.&nbsp; Pick up a cheap magnetic cartridge (it MUST be a magnetic cartridge) somewhere and mount it on the end of a yardstick.&nbsp; Insert about a 6&quot; -8&quot; piece of heavy wire (cut from a clothes hangar) through a hole in the yardstick about 10&quot; from the end opposite the phono cartridge.&nbsp; Wrap this wire about the middle with enough masking (or other type) tape to keep the yardstick held about the middle of the heavy wire when you fasten it in a vertical position to some sort of frame (an old picture frame? Or a frame made of scrap wood?).&nbsp; This will provide the swivel point for up/down and left/right movement of the yardstick &quot;tone arm&quot;.<br /><br />Run your wires (thin as you can get . . . strip them from an old piece of telephone hookup wire) from the cartridge down to the swivel point (tape them about 3 places along the yardstick to keep them on the yardstick) and make a loose loop at the swivel point so the yardstick can easily move around without the wires pulling on it.&nbsp; Fasten the wires to the support frame to keep them from moving around, then leave a few inches loose from where they are fastened to the frame -- the ends of these will be stripped to expose the wire ends which will be connected to an older stereo amp that has a PHONO input on the back.<br /><br />The last thing is to put enough weight on the end of the yardstick opposite the cartridge to almost lift the cartridge &quot;see saw&quot; style . . . you want the weight of the cartridge on the cylinder to be only about 3 ounces which is about right to play the cylinder without wear on the grooves.<br /><br />Have a stereo inclined friend who is also knowledgeable about electronics to hook those loose wire ends to a stereo cable with RCA connectors on the end to plug into the amp.&nbsp; If the amp has a mono button, push it to the mono position (since the old cylinder is mono anyway) . . . adjust the Balance knob to get the sound balanced from both left and right speakers.<br /><br />Then you run the cylinder using the Edison player and play up the music using your new ersatz electronic tone arm and stereo system.&nbsp; If you have a CD recorder you can connect it to the &quot;Tape Out&quot; connection on the stereo amp and record the music on a CD (you could also record it on a CD with your computer if you have the connections for that).<br /><br />Sorry if this was a bit long, but maybe it well help you to listen to, and record, the cylinder music with a minimum of wear to the cylinder.

				Yeah, man . . . don&#39;t need wrenches, drifts, pullers, muffler bearing stretchers, and all those other mechanics&#39; gizmos to play a cylinder through your stereo --- just a stick, tape, coat hanger, wire, some wood, nails, hammer, and a cartridge and you can be listenin&#39; to the Edison or Sousa bands on your stereo!! :)<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; I have never rebuilt an engine or any other ped, scooter, MC, or automotive part beyond changing the oil and light bulbs.&nbsp; So I&#39;m a slow learner, but I do pick up some good mechanicin&#39; skills at the fixits!!
