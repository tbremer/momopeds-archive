				Job description:<br />&nbsp;<br />Looking for a good troll. Our past trolls were totally annoying. Do you have bad social skills? Are you relentless and kinda crazy? Do you have at least 14 hours a day to troll our site and say shit just to get under the skin of others? If the answer is &#39;yes&#39; to these, you may be right for the job. <br /><br />Post below and lets see if you have what it takes.<br />

				Man if I had the time I could be good at this.&nbsp; Lemme try:<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;Are you anally fixated, butt pirates talking about poop? Pffft, figures, I joined this site as a dare from my friends, they said just having an account would make me gay.&nbsp; Real men ride motorcycles, butt naked so their huge balls can feel the breeze.&nbsp; You fucking derelict hippies don&#39;t have balls or anything else between your legs that&#39;s why you ride mopeds, you couldn&#39;t handle anything real and manly.&nbsp; &nbsp;My grandmothers cock is larger than your moped you pussies.&nbsp; This site is full of hipster douche-bags and wannabes who...&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;Frankly never-mind,&nbsp; I don&#39;t want the job, I thought maybe I did but it just became labored, maybe if I was a younger man I could hang, it just took way to long to get that out.&nbsp; When I tried to come up with an analogy for what the hipster douche-bags and wannabes could not do, or tell apart from, or who&#39;s requisite skill was extremely low, everything just felt forced and sounded uninspired.&nbsp; That up there is just crap, sorry for wasting your time guys, I&#39;m just going to go back to my position of CoMo noob trying to have get-together-fix-it&#39;s, trying to build up his peds and learn a few things from the guys who have done it before.&nbsp; I wish you all the luck in filling the position of Forum Troll , I appreciate the opportunity, I know your time is valuable.&nbsp; I wanted to be a team player and step up to fill the spot needed but I&#39;m just not cut out for Forum Troll.<br /><br />It&#39;s just the kind of thing that looks easy when you see it, but when the rubber meets the road it&#39;s way harder than you would imagine, I have a new respect for your Forum Trolls of the world, it&#39;s a gift you have to be born with.&nbsp;

				Ryne and I did sell like 8 in one day to a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader and all of her friends.&nbsp; Most annoying people on earth.&nbsp; But we got to go to Brennan&#39;s for drinks on the owner.&nbsp; But we made like $8k that day, and we made $8/hr, so it&#39;s the least he could do.<br /><br />Selling Chinese shit scooters is the way to go.&nbsp; You just gotta do it popcycle-style.&nbsp; Sell for one riding season, close shop and leave town before they all break.

				Well, by golly I can understand that girl&#39;s angst!!&nbsp; When I was in HS and was having a lot of trouble in some class, I told the teacher, &quot;Hell, I&#39;ll just become a cruise ship gigolo!&quot;.&nbsp; She got all warped and sent me to the office ... the Principal nearly busted a gut laughing when I told him what I said.&nbsp; He said that might not be such a bad job, then sent me back to class with a note to the teacher that he chewed me out real good and counseled me.<br /><br />I still didn&#39;t do worth a damn in her class!!&nbsp; Didn&#39;t make a vary good gigolo in my later life, either.&nbsp; Loozer!!
