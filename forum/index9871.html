			Ok so i havent really messed with the pinto since i wrecked it but tonight we brought it back to life. Added straight bars, new headlight, and a bunch of other BS that&#39;s besides the point. So when i crashed my bike i remember lots of tranny fluid everywhere. so we go to fill it up and i notice there is no drain screw...... THATS WHY I CRASHED haha or not? idk... i didnt tighten it down enough and it worked its way out, sprayed tranny fluid on the ground, my rear wheel hit it and i did a fish tale to fail. <br /><br />LESSON: do tighten your drain screw! <br />jesus!
