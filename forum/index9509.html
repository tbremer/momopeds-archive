				If you&#39;re riding a moped, you&#39;re going to need to learn to fix it regularly.&nbsp; I mean, what happens when you&#39;re 5 miles from home and you break down?&nbsp; You gonna call Jimmy to drive from South City to O&#39;Fallon to bail you out?&nbsp; Learn your bike.

				Thanks Jimmy!&nbsp; I will contact you tomorrow.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you everyone else for your posts... I do plan on learning how to fix these mopeds... I am planning on taking a small motor repair class this fall to learn the basics of small motors.&nbsp; I have droped by the fort on a fix it day, but I am a pastor of a church here in O&#39;Fallon so it is tough to get to the fix it days on Sundays to learn more so I have to do what I can.&nbsp; I have also had the honor of riding with you all in your mini ralley this past spring.&nbsp; Looking forward to getting to know you all better in the future and also riding with you all on more occassions!&nbsp; You all are great people!<br /><br />

				Poop on your thread. Make jimmy fix it for a small fee, ask for a garauntee it won&#39;t break anymore. Variated peds are cool, but don&#39;t ramp your own variator on a hobbit. I&#39;m rollin a hobbit in chi town. Ill feel bad if it breaks and I have 2 fix it. I don&#39;t like their obvious design flaws, just sayin. Good for you if you do. Sorry to poop on your hobbit parade. Mali mike will soon have the fasted hobbit in KC.

				Probably the fastest in Missouri...but you would need to make it to denver to prove that. I hear the goings out westward are not for old jimbo...I saw lots of hobbits at the rally. None so fast they were un-trumpable but you werent there and its not like I need to prove that hobbits are the bees knees, thats for the cool kids to do. I&#39;ll stick to something italian or french... I always loved euros..not just the type you spend on a cup o java, or the girls who dont shave...Ya know, I dont even like hobbits..havent you spoke with Mark,,, its cheatin..but so is any variated case inducted bike right? I&#39;m such a cheater (like a fortune cookie)...IN BED

				yeah, but a different style. robins right about the difference. i have a couple hobbits, then i got an express.....<br />i thought &quot;there is no way i&#39;m riding that POS&quot; so i cut it up and put the drivetrain on a hobbit frame. and fucked with the engine to get rid of that carb and oil pump shit. there&#39;s an old thread on here called hobbit express. i still don&#39;t ride it

				Have to chime in with my 2 cents. Hobbits are badass. I love mine. The most reliable bike I own and it is a 50cc ripper. It has all the goodies but a kit. It can pull 2 people riding it up a hill. hobbits are awesome.<br /><br />And it is about time y&#39;all started fixing bikes for cash. I have made $100 and some nice bottles of wine for fixing lawnmowers and a ped this year.

				Variators pull people up hills. Hobbits just happen to have them. Now if only they could figure out a way to make the case similar to a pugeot without copying the design...Dont redesign the wheel, make that wheel a 2 piece wheel so you have to tighten the bolts every time you drive. <br /><br />Hobbit- <br />(http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v423/cultwagen/Motorcycles/Picture003.jpg)<br />Express-<br />(http://jleibovitch.tripod.com/191259c0.jpg)<br /><br />Tell me you can see a difference
