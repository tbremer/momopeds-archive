				So some of you don&#39;t know me...some of you have forgotten me...and one of you bought my vespa 50 special.&nbsp; How is the rebuild for that going Z?&nbsp; <br /><br />For those who have no idea who this is.&nbsp; I&#39;m Phil, I played mopeds for a while then disappeared to Thailand...I came back to a pregnant wife and now have an eight month old son.<br /><br />Anycrap...the Bat has been down for the last several months due to a few things.&nbsp; <br /><br />1. Laziness<br />2. Being a new dad<br />3. Going back to school<br /><br />So here is the deal.&nbsp; I just dropped some cash on repairs for the Bat-Out-Of-Hell-Avus.&nbsp; Can we say White Wall Tires....hells yeah bitches!<br /><br />So I will be getting a new throttle cable, wheels and chain tensioner...<br /><br />I am also itching to give the batavus a good cleaning and...<br /><br />PAINT THE MOTHA LICKER!<br /><br />I have been thinking about classic black and white, but I figure ifn anyone wants to help with a rebuild and paint job I would be down for doing that over the weekend of the 4th.<br /><br />Give me a holla yo and we can play mopeds together.
