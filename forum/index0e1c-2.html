			<strong>day-clen</strong>:
			<br />
			anyone ever had a problem with a vm20 w/ the o ring that seals between the spot in the float bowl that goes to the main jet to the emulsion tube?&nbsp; If this isnt sealing it would allow fuel through and cause rich running condition reguardless of the jet size correct?<br />Sorry for the shitty description and no pictures, hopefully thats enough info to work with.

			I think what I referred to as the emullsion tube is the needle jet actually
