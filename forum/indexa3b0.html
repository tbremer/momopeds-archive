				Uh... someone who knows I am getting into mopeds sent me an explicit link. I&#39;m not going to post the link in here.&nbsp; <br /><br />I haven&#39;t watched it, but from the stills, it looks pretty &quot;rough&quot; and the setting appears to be the &quot;1977 Mopeds&quot; shop.<br /><br />While I&#39;m not philosophically opposed to adult films, I&#39;d prefer not to mix it with my moped interests - particularly with my daughter being so interested in my mopeds.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#39;m unsure if I want to do any further business with those guys.&nbsp; Maybe I am just being a prude, but this bothers me.&nbsp; <br />

				It&#39;s not uncommon.&nbsp; Popcycle Motors (used to be in the Central West End) did a nude photo shoot during non-store hours when I worked there.&nbsp; I bet more motor-type businesses have had porn shot there than you&#39;d think.<br /><br />But, 1977 sucks for a lot of reasons.&nbsp; They, as policy, do not answer e-mails.&nbsp; They don&#39;t ship the right things.&nbsp; They (at least used to be) much more expensive than other shops.&nbsp; They still owe me $80...&nbsp; The only way I&#39;ve gotten them to contact me if by posting a bitchy public thread on MA.&nbsp; If you leave a phone message, they don&#39;t call back.&nbsp; If you send an e-mail, they don&#39;t write back.&nbsp; If you post a bitchy MA thread they&#39;re calling and e-mailing you in 30 seconds.&nbsp; I know some people have had good experiences with them, but they&#39;ve burnt me too many times to order from them, and I don&#39;t like the way they do business.&nbsp; Some porno is the last thing I&#39;d worry about.<br /><br />Also, at least post the link dude.&nbsp; Don&#39;t leave us hangin.

				I noticed that ordering from them is neigh on impossible on my schedule since you have to call them for everything.&nbsp; <br />I&#39;ve only ordered a couple things from them in the past, but with so few sources, I hate to write one off because they also host adult films in their shop.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as the link... I hesitate.&nbsp; I don&#39;t especially want to get perma-banned for posting such things in open forum.&nbsp; There&#39;s nothing to keep underage folks from coming in here.&nbsp; If someone wants to e-mail me, I&#39;ll e-mail the link back.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				There are multiple threads on MA about this if you want more info...as far as getting it emailed (?) I found those videos the good ol&#39; fashioned way!&nbsp; By looking at porn.<br /><br />I&#39;m sorta with Mike on this too.&nbsp; They didnt really fuck me over, but they did send me a lot of the wrong shit (although it was more expensive than what I ordered.)&nbsp; And, they really don&#39;t respond to email. I think they checked it, realized they fucked up, and sent me a bunch of stickers and random shit.

				For the record, on this forum, the only rule we are bound to stick to is that we cannot HOST porn.&nbsp; But we can link to it all we want.&nbsp; It&#39;s my server, and that one rule is the hosting company&#39;s rule.&nbsp; If it were completely owned by me, I&#39;d let anyone post anything they want.&nbsp; So, anyone can link to any porn they want, without fear of banishment.<br /><br />I mean shit, if you come to an IRE party where Garrrettt has computer access, I guarantee you&#39;re gonna see worse than some good ol&#39; fashion porn.&nbsp; Why should the website be any different?<br /><br />OPEN THE FLOODGATES.

				77 is my last resort when it comes to parts, i actually did an order with them just this last week and it showed up right on time. it shipped out of georgia, so maybe they have a separate shipper handling orders now? but everything was in the box and packed tight and safe, no damage or anything and it had an extra freebie in the box. treats order came the next day and the box was destroyed.. but everything was just fine. and i got a free mozart tape =D (i like classical music) <br /><br />personally? it has helped them redeem some points (being on time and shipping the right stuff) but theyre still on the low area of my list when it comes to ordering parts. besides, it seems a rare day when they have something and treats doesnt.<br />

				I had one really bad experience with 1977. It was during the winter when they were transferring stuff from Kzoo to SF, and I think I waited 2 months for the stuff I ordered. It was lame, but I did finally get it, and I know they were being bitched at by a lot of people while all that was going on. I guess I did get the wrong thing once too, but it wasn&#39;t wrong enough to make me want to send it back. Other than that, I&#39;ve had good experiences with 1977. I think they&#39;ve really made a lot of improvements lately. Their shipping is much better and their prices are truly competitive -- they&#39;re actually cheaper than treats for some stuff. <br /><br />As for the porn, yeah, there was a big blow-up about that over on MA for a while. The MopedWarehouse guys took it and ran with it, and since they&#39;re scum of the earth, that just made me not care even more. It&#39;s their shop and their bike, and they&#39;re allowed to do what they want with it. They never linked to it or advertised it, so it&#39;s not like they&#39;re trying to shove their moped porn down our ... throats. From what I understand/remember, the company who did the shoot was a local SF company, so it was more of a &quot;let&#39;s work with a local company&quot; thing rather than a &quot;I think it would be a great idea to make porn in here too&quot; kind of thing (someone feel free to correct me on that, if you remember/know better than I do).&nbsp; You&#39;ll never see me sitting on that LTD though, haha. <br /><br />The link might be on the history page of the shop links, or somewhere else... not sure though. <br /><br />And I was gonna say, although Mike already said it for me, I don&#39;t think anyone on this forum is gonna ban you for linking to porn. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="indexbef6-2.html?topic=4225.msg48512#msg48512">Quote from: Mike P&#39;s in Walter&#39;s sink on March 14, 2010, 09:02:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I mean shit, if you come to an IRE party where Garrrettt has computer access, I guarantee you&#39;re gonna see worse than some good ol&#39; fashion porn.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> ^ Truth.

				i wasnt hating, i was actually very satisfied, theyve done me wrong in the past, but it got fixed eventually, and this last order really redeemed alot of points. treats hasnt done anything so far to upset me, and it comes down to which one has the part i need at this point.

				1977 has straight up screwed me.&nbsp; They&#39;ve NEVER gotten an order right for me since 2007.&nbsp; Everytime I&#39;ve had to e-mail repeatedly, and call them up.&nbsp; A few times they made it right.&nbsp; Two times they did not.&nbsp; The only way I did get them to make it right was to make one of those bitchy public MA posts about how they suck and don&#39;t send me the right shit.&nbsp; Then Pat called me within 15 minutes of posting.&nbsp; They still owe me a PHBG float bowl.&nbsp; Plus, and I guess this could be seen as my bad, but I ordered case boring and decided I could do it myself for $16 instead of paying them $80 and asked for a refund via e-mail multiple times, and via phone messages at least twice.&nbsp; No response.&nbsp; So they owe me $80 and a float bowl and have never made right despite repeated attempts.&nbsp; Plus, they&#39;ve changed their ordering system a few times, so there are no records of my orders to try to get my $ back.&nbsp; So, fuck them in the ass sans lube.<br /><br />Yeah, Treats has gotten shit wrong for me too, but with one e-mail they&#39;ve always made it right, if not also sent free shit to me.&nbsp; I ordered from Benji when he was just on MA selling stuff, the on just ebay selling stuff, and now on Treats own site.&nbsp; He used to ALWAYS send free carb jets, or gaskets, or whatever fit your order.&nbsp; Treats has always been amazing, even if they got your shit wrong sometimes.&nbsp; One time they only forgot to send me an exhaust gasket, and to make it right they sent a full e50 gasket set, plus a couple bing jets.&nbsp; That shit doesn&#39;t happen with 1977.<br /><br />If you want to give your $ to people who are really cool and help people out, give it to Treats.&nbsp; If you want your parts with no problems, give your $ to Handybikes, or Quarterkick, or some of the other shops.&nbsp; If you want the wrong thing, shitty service and the possibility of getting fucked over completely, order from 1977.<br /><br />I&#39;ve met Dan in person, and talked to Pat on the phone for a while.&nbsp; They are both rad dudes, no doubt, but they can&#39;t run a business well.

				whoa, sorry to offend u matt. just saying that noone gets it right all the time. ive heard a few people who are getting into peds say &quot;i heard 1977mopeds sucks so im not going to order from them ever&quot; and im sure if i told everyone getting into peds that treats has forgotten to ship my jets every time i ordered them, they would prob have a problem with treats too. my reaction to this thread was that i feel like some people scare others away from using certain stores and that isnt fair, that&#39;s all.

Kind of like the Better Business Bureau for mopeds. that is why these threads get started.<br />I had heard horror stories from others about 77 before I ever ordered from them. After several orders I found out that it was all true.<br /><br />So if you like slow service, no e-mail response, false advertising, and used parts instead of new, go to 1977.

				i got a used spark plug once from 1977.<br /><br />Treats and 77 are very different. Benji, Jimmy and Rufus have done a great job with treats, totally inventorying everything and running a tight ship. Not as much freebies and deals as before, but they run a very legitimate operation. 77 (like treats) has their issues and are often slower to reply. I know they always play the &quot;busy&quot; card which they often are, but sometimes its overplayed. They offer more as far as advice, repairs and so on, and that takes a considerable amount of time. Dan and Pat are really nice guys that I know are working hard to help out the community. Everyone at 77 is really nice, but its a very different operation than treats.
