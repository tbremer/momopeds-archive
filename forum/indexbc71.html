				Sorry, I can&#39;t remember names, but I do remember you asking about a Moby gas cap. I ran across this today on ebay. Hope it helps.<br /><br />http://cgi.ebay.com/MOTOBECANE-NEW-GAS-CAP_W0QQitemZ190295078044QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item190295078044&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&amp;_trkparms=72%3A1205%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318%7C301%3A0%7C293%3A1%7C294%3A50

				Probably Jackie... I&#39;m not sure if she gets on here. I think Chuck is her only contact to the rest of us. I guess Scott should have got her number when she left my place on sunday evening. Ohh well she supposedly lives right down the street.. but hell if I know which house.<br /><br />Hopefully chuck can hook her up with the moby gas cap<br /><br /><br />I think your blue moby and my red Vespa Si were the 2 nicest stock peds in the rally.

				I can go look for it.&nbsp; I saw it bouncing it&#39;s way down the street right near the beginning of Saturday&#39;s ride.&nbsp; Only reason I didn&#39;t stop is because someone else did and I thought they were getting it, but I guess they didn&#39;t.

				You wanna help me screen print tonight. I&#39;m taking shirts to LA for the Rally. I need to go to Salvation Army and pick up some more.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure when your detailing party is. If you pre-arranged this with me, you probably did it when I was drunk.. so I dont remember. Colt 45 was awsome on Saturday night.

				I have to go by chucks to talk to matt and give him some crank arm pins. We might have to work on the trailer. So it really depends. I&#39;ll promise to work on them after dark, if we dont work on the trailer, I&#39;ll do them right after I go get my new phone. I&#39;m pretty sure my phone will be in and out of service today, and scott has class, so he wont be home till late. Maybe I&#39;ll go to chucks and have her call you or something? I&#39;m hoping my new phone works but I&#39;m switching companies and keeping my old number. All I know is if it doesnt work by the time I got to LA. I&#39;m gonna kick some ass<br /><br />I was gonna swing by the salvation army by the t-mobile store.. I&#39;ll just grab lots of plain shirts. I&#39;ve got quite a few colors of inks.. so when I print I&#39;m gonna be making lots of shirts.

				I gotta go pick up my phone, get shirts and then drop crank arm pins at chucks. Just talked to matt. He says he is gonna try and work on the trailer himself.. maybe get a hand flipping it over. But it seems like he is getting help from other people. If he needs my help I&#39;ll help but if he doesnt I&#39;m screen printing. So I&#39;ll just call you about 30 mins before I screen print.

				OK I got the axel off the trailer and re-attached it to the bottom of the leaf springs.<br />this gives us almost 4 more inches above the tires.<br />im going to take the fenders off for now, and shorten them.<br />the wheel bearing on the left side has a scary amount of end play, and a bad seal....so.<br />the fenders are on hold while i get a new seal, re-pack the bearings, and adjust the bearing preload back into spec (if possiable)<br />if i have any trailer related issues i will keep everyone posted.
