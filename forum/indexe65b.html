			the lights work? the brakes don&#39;t squeak? the horn works? It doesn&#39;t drip gas? it doesn&#39;t 4 stroke? Boy. I wish I could say any of those for mine. But seriously, porting is all labor, so that&#39;s the cheapest. mod... Then a upgraded exhaust, and soon followed by a bigger carb and intake. cha-ching.

			If you don&#39;t want to spend any money you can:<br />-bore out the stock 12mm bing carburetor to 14mm (I&#39;ve never done this, but I&#39;ve read it&#39;s not hard on Moped Army)<br />-drill some holes in the exhaust baffles - just like 2...maybe 3.&nbsp; But start with 1, see how that effects things, try another, etc.<br />-port the intake and exhaust<br />-take apart the wheel bearings, clean, and regrease them<br />-make sure your chain is well lubed<br />-make sure your timing is set right<br /><br />If you want to spend a little bit of money:<br />-buy a performance exhaust<br />-buy a 15m bing carb (and a bunch of jets)<br />-if it&#39;s a one speed, you can tune the clutch to engage later, or get a three shoe clutch and tune that<br />-port the intake and exhaust<br />-take apart the wheel bearings, and replace them<br />-replace the chain<br />-make sure your timing is set right<br /><br />If you want to spend a lot of money:<br />-buy a kit (anywhere from 65cc to 80cc - in general: the bigger the faster, but also harder to tune right and usually more expensive)<br />-match the transfer ports in the kit cylinder to the transfer ports in the case<br />-buy a performance exhaust<br />-buy a big dellorto carb (19mm or 21mm) and a bunch of jets<br />-make sure the intake and exhaust ports match the new intake and exhaust you&#39;re potting on there - if not, port them to match<br />-take apart the wheel bearings, and replace them<br />-replace the fork, or at least rebuild the stock one<br />-replace the chain<br />-make sure your timing is set right<br />-get new tires and tubes<br /><br />If you want to spend your life savings and try to break 70mph:<br />-buy an 80cc kit (like the 80cc gilardoni reed valve kit)<br />-bore out your engine case to accept the huge sleeve<br />-match the transfer ports in the kit cylinder to the transfer ports in the case (you can send the case to 1977 mopeds to have this done for a good chunk of change)<br />-buy a jollymoto brand or other handmade exhaust<br />-buy a huge carb (like a 24mm mikuni flat slide)<br />-make a custom intake for the carb<br />-buy a fully stuffed racing crank, new bearings, and new oil seals to rebuild a 1 speed engine<br />-buy a three shoe clutch and tune it<br />-buy a CDI ignition system<br />-buy new wheels, or NOS ones<br />-buy a new chain<br />-buy new tires and tubes<br />-buy a new fork<br />-fabricate a disc brake system - you&#39;ll need it<br /><br />Pick your poison.&nbsp; If you do the last one, get a helmet and life insurance.
