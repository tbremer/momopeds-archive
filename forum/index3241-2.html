				All my peds have pedals, the arms are secure.<br /><br />Little hint for the noobz. Place the pedal arm pin in, in the direction that will need the most space filled, ie the forward turning part. If you put them upside down your arms wont be so tizight.<br /><br />Not that this info helped anyone but I thought it was very applicable since most people have pedal arm problems.. or no pedals at all :(

				I don&#39;t know what Tomos crank arm pins you&#39;re looking at, but I ordered the smallest ones I could find (I think they&#39;re 8.5mm) and they still won&#39;t go in the new crank arms I got for my Tomos.

				Well, yeah, a table with sizes would be nice, but who knows all the sizes? If you all want to figure that out, I&#39;d be happy to put it in there. Still though, the stock size doesn&#39;t explain why my new Tomos pedal crank arms don&#39;t fit with either the new or old crank arm pins that I&#39;ve got.

				Are you sure you put the pins in correctly? Sometimes they have lips on them to prevent you putting them in the wrong way, or on the wrong side. <br /><br />I&#39;d have to see them to help you figure out what will work.

				Yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure they just don&#39;t fit. I&#39;ve tried them from every angle, I&#39;ve bashed on them endlessly with a hammer, I&#39;ve hosed them down in PB Blaster and WD40, and the pins just won&#39;t go all the way in. The old pedal arms and the old pedal arm pins go on and off no problems. I don&#39;t remember if the new pins work with the old arms, but I&#39;m pretty sure the old pins don&#39;t work with the new arms. It&#39;s just one more thing on the list of stuff that should be easy but is a heap of frustration.

				with the pedal arm off the shaft, the pin should slide right in... no hammering neccessary ...the flat side on the pin,should be turned to face the flat side on the shaft,,I believe its what&#39;s called an interference fit...the pin&#39;s flat side is wedged along its length so the further in it is pulled (with the threads) or tapped, (hammered in) the tighter it gets...Removing a pin usually ruins it. So having spares on hand is recommended....French bikes, have, usually a smaller pins, than the rest...

				I&#39;ll be over if I feel up to it, but I&#39;m probably just going to sit around like a lump. I&#39;ve got stuff that needs fixing, but I don&#39;t have the parts to fix any of it right now. If I do come, you really don&#39;t want me showing up when I wake up (unless you like people knocking on your door early on Sunday morning). When is everyone else planning on showing up?
