				Did you see the end of the video?&nbsp; All of those chambers were awesome!<br /><br />The state of cars these days kind of makes me sick.&nbsp; There is no reason to have all of these giant cars on the road when the majority of the time that they are on the road there is only one person in them.&nbsp; I hate how cars are status symbols.&nbsp; Every time they introduce a new version of a particular model it is almost always bigger.<br /><br />I&#39;m with Eugene, I&#39;d love to have that car.

				Drool!!!!&nbsp; Looks like they bought the body from the Berkeley factory.<br /><br />Some of those little 2 cycle cars were really neat.&nbsp; For example, the 3 cylinder DKW had 3 coils lined up beside the engine head, with a wire from each one to its individual spark plug.&nbsp; The Goggomobile coupe had a preselector electric transmission . . . with a little H-pattern switch on the dash, just select the next gear you wish to have, the tap the clutch pedal and it is instantly shifted (the would be nice on a dragster hotrod!!).&nbsp; The Messershmitt&nbsp; went in reverse by killing the engine and starting it up running backwards.&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; etc.

				Here&#39;s the 2 cycle 3-cylinder DKW with the engine running - 3 sets of points, shooting the juice from 3 coils to the 3 spark plugs:<br /><br />//www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_2HIdZOdgw<br /><br />

				yeah, those messerschmitts are weird. i love the idea of having multiple reverse gears, hahaha.<br /><br />i saw an ad for one of those DKWs recently. i want one badly. in the ad it said something about how the engine was so much better than a 4-stroke because it only had 7 moving parts.

				I&#39;ve owned 3 Messerschmitts.&nbsp; The last one I drove from Fort Dix, NJ to Little Rock, AR in 1969.&nbsp; Mostly doing about 50 - 55 mph.&nbsp; Top speed was about 70 mph but you couldn&#39;t do that for very long without it seizing.<br /><br />Although it had the same 4 gears in reverse as in forward, the steering was to quick (1/4 turn lock to lock) that you would lose control and probably wreck if you wend any further than 2nd gear in reverse.<br /><br />I also had many more of different makes of those little 1 and 2 cylinder cars back in the 1960s up to the 1980s when I collected them.

				Mark, those little blue cars look like Autobianchi Bianchinas, with 2 cylinder air cooled 4 cycle FIAT drive trains.&nbsp; The Vespa 400 looked very similar.

				A-ko, it has been so many years since I have seen either type of car that I could easily confuse the twain, especially if viewed from the front<br /><br />However, there are a few easy ways to distinguish a Bianchina from a Vespa from the front:<br /><br />The Bianchina headlights, and the upper fender behind them project slightly beyond the lower wheel well area of the fender.&nbsp; The Vespa headlights are closer together and located slightly inside the fender sides.<br /><br />The Bianchina headlights project forward from the fenders with chrome trim rings.&nbsp; The Vespa headlights are slightly Frenched (inset) and do not have chrome rings.<br /><br />The Bianchina has white rubber bumper overriders located at the ends of the bumpers and directly under the headlights with the turn signals inside the overriders.&nbsp; The vespa has chrome overriders located below the inside edge of the headlights with the bumper extending beyond the overriders and the turn signals located directly under the headlights and outside the overrider locations.<br /><br />I would love to have one of each!!&nbsp; I used to have 3 Bianchinas and 1 Vespa &amp; loved &#39;em all.<br /><br />Smiff<br />
