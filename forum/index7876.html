				You should be able to get a title with a MO bill of sale ... or at least, that&#39;s what we always do, since KS requires titles too. If can&#39;t and you really need a title, talk to us. We might be able to get you one if you can someone in MO to write you up a bill of sale.

				We just take the MO bill of sale to the treasurer&#39;s office, hand it to them, pay them money, and walk out with a plate and registration papers. They mail you the title a few weeks later. The only snafu is that sometimes they decide that you need to get it inspected, which would be a problem if we didn&#39;t have the moped with us. If that happened though, there are two satellite offices where you might get a different answer on another day. I also have a thing I found on one of their websites that says that motorized bicycles do not need to be inspected. Whether that trumps the &quot;out of state vehicles need to be inspected&quot; part or not, I&#39;m not sure, but I&#39;m going to print it and bring it along next time I go there just in case.
