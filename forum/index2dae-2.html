				hi allz, I had so much fun at the como rally that I wanted to build a bike for next year. Gila&#39;d Za going in a magnum so I wanted to stop better too.&nbsp; Bought the ebr hydro fur magnum. The only problem I am having is that the threaded crown tube looked way to long. benji sez you don&#39;t have to cut it down..so nice I am just putting it together incorrectly. I know the tube is longer to make up for the thicker top plate but when I mock everything up I still have all sorts of tube sticking out... like almost an inch to much. I am using the old bearing cups and decided to go with the caged bearings. The caged ball bearings are like a hair smaller but not enought to make up for the difference. The only other thing I can think of is that maybe I need new bearing cups that don&#39;t recess as far into the neck tube?? I bought the tomos puch bearing set to evaluate any possible differences but not sure yet. I can trade shawarma for sound advice.. Thank you

				I like pickles of all sorts, primarily turnips, however I will make a point to check out your manlied ones! I also wanted to say something about those EBR&#39;s. After doing some measuring and talking to treats I found that they sent me EBR&#39;s for a Hobbit. Glad I didn&#39;t modify em yet. They got back to me on Sunday and said they&#39;d ship out the proper set Monday with a return shipping label... those guys never stop making moped dreams come true.<br />P.S. - thank you Nash for the chainX2
