				Our method of mardi gras celebrating is more like meet at our place, have some drinks, grab some flasks for a walk through the chaos, see lots of drunkass idiots, see some boobies, go back to our place and drink till you puke on our couch.

				The trick is to get in and out of Soulard before you have to pee. And I think the case of Gatorade Jill brought last year was the only thing keeping our apt. from turning into a full scale vomitorium haha<br /><br />I&#39;m going to try and behave myself a little better this year, ha.

				I&#39;m not sure the king cake tradition made it to St. Louis.&nbsp; All we got is the drink-until-you&#39;re-comfortable-showing-your-privates-to-strangers-for-three-cents-worth-of-beads-but-don&#39;t-remember-until-you-see-the-pics-on-the-interwebs tradition.&nbsp; But we&#39;ll see what we can do about the fetus cake.

				There is totally king cake in St. Louis. I bought some when I was there last year in February. I spent an hour getting lost (even with the GPS) to go get it, and it was totally worth it.

				I saw one of them cakes with the little plastic baby once. They scare me, someone could choke on that little guy. <br />I bet most of the bakerys in the soulard area would have them in the next couple of weeks, but I am not sure how it would look after being mailed, but I will see if I can find one.

				You know, it&#39;d be easier if all you pedders west of us just came here for Mardi Gras.&nbsp; It is absurd, and fun.<br /><br />Also, costumes should be mandatory this year.
