				jimmy, remember when you de-shimmed my clutch and I told you about a rattle on the bike (It was there before the shim was removed)? <br /><br />here&#39;s a post about it from MA, maybe you could advise me?

				yup, <br /><br />I can get &#39;er up to about 32 and the rattle starts at right around 28mph. i&#39;ve been WOT to that point, then back it of to the exact point to maintaining 28. i&#39;d love to go faster and add a asmall kit etc to get to 40MPH, but the rattle freaks me out. like small change in a tiny tin dryer.

				I&#39;ll just have to bring it back to fix it when i return. It&#39;s definitely in the engine somewhere. i really need a nice, long stretch of quiet street with no traffic so I can really ride fast without having to pay attention to what other people are doing so I can pinpoint it.

The clutch isn&#39;t engaged at high speeds? Its weird, because I get to 28 and it starts and then I can go up to 32 and it keeps rattling. Shoudl i not get a small kit and just leave it well enough alone and concentrate on the project bike I&#39;m waiting to buy? I&#39;d hate to screw with something that is fine as it is.

				Yeah, the reason I would get a kit at all is so you can bolt it up without the clamp flange deal...that thing restricts your exhuast .... but a nice 50cc Athena a pipe and a carb, and you be in the 35-40 range...depending on a few variables...<br />PS<br />Ill take a sachs 504 crank while your feeling all generous and shit!

				I think it may be speedometer related. It&#39;s definitely coming from the front wheel. you were right, it ain&#39;t the engine at all (like i really doubted you, Sachs Jedi Master). now, what to do....hmmmm
