				Hey Gangs... <br /><br />We have set our date for the BBQ fund raiser for Brian. It will be Sat Oct 8th. 11am-3pm <br /><br />First Assembly of God<br />8759 Veterans Memorial Pkwy<br />O&#39;Fallon, MO 63366<br /><br />We will have BBQ brats, pork steaks, chicken, hotdogs, soda and other stuff!! <br /><br />Come out and get some great BBQ cooked by Terrell. Its SOOO Good!<br /><br />Bring all ur members, family and friends! We need to raise as much as we can for Brian!!<br /><br />ALSO BRING UR PEDS , we plan on riding 30-40 miles around O&#39;fallon afterwards ...<br /><br />unless ur scared..lol we usually ride 60 so we can add more mileage if u want!<br /><br />If u plan on riding ...let me know... so we have a idea for the routing. It will give a very tiny taste of what our rally ride will be like<br /><br /><br />

				HR Leaders, since the HR group has no funds in their tresury, the church will loan the HR group the money to purchase all the meat and food to sell, as well as provide a bank for making change while selling.&nbsp; The church will have to be paid back the food cost and the bank off the top.&nbsp; Just let me know what you all need and it is done.&nbsp; : )&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Ok, Dan, Larry, On October 8th we need to have all the supplies and utensiles out of the kitchen and also all the mopeds that are needed for the ride out of the storage area by noon, and moved to the front of the church.... Because as it turns out I had already rented out the fellowship hall to the AA womens group from 1-4pm on that Saturday.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Its not an issue, and won&#39;t be a problem,&nbsp; we just will need to make sure we get the stuff the HR needs for the bbq and moped ride out of there by noon.&nbsp; &nbsp;We will just clean up from the bbq after the ride. <br /><br />Sorry for the inconvience, <br /><br />Aaron<br />

				Thanks&nbsp; all, it was fun!<br /><br />&nbsp;I really love the flip...its cheap, convenient&nbsp; and it has a decent video editing software ON the flip itself. It gets great night shots(not all grainy), battery power forever AND &#39;magic movie&#39; edits all your shots for you as long as you shoot with editing in mind.<br />
