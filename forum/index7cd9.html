			Hey everybody! We (CT &amp; BM) are hosting a moped/scooter/anything!! camp out in lawrence. The spot we have picked out is great its right off the lake/river and is a 15-20 min drive to down town lawrence! so yea if you have a day or so off come hang out, pretty sure we will be having a long ride around the lake!.

			Woot! <br /><br />And I dunno if you&#39;re looking for ways we can entertain ourselves, but this could be combined with the cheesy sweater/pumpkin ride. Put on cheesy sweaters, ride to pumpkin patch, see who can get biggest/most pumpkin home on moped .... carve pumpkins, maybe? Just a thought. Keeping it separate for the sake of having more rides is dandy too.
