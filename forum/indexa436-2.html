				Yep. It&#39;s that time of year again. I know most of you CoMo/StL people don&#39;t go to this rally as it&#39;s quite far away, but holy shit, it&#39;s worth it. <br /><br />So yeah, this is the thread to gauge interest. I&#39;m not promising any rides, although if I do end up promising rides, Chris has already claimed dibs on one spot. I&#39;m not sure who else is going or how many spots they have in their respective vehicles, but knowing how many people want to come is a good thing to start with.<br /><br />Who is already planning on going, and who might be interested if they could get time off from work/scrape together enough money? <br /><br />Edit: people who&#39;ve said they might be going/interested, just to get a count started.<br /><br />-Me<br />-Brett<br />-Kenden<br />-Becca<br />-Chris<br />-Ed and Trin<br />-Spencer<br />-Daryl<br />-Ashley

				@ BeccaD<br /><br />This is one hell of a first rally to go to.&nbsp; You won&#39;t be disapointed.&nbsp; the Austin guys always do it up right.&nbsp; Last year there were ware house parties and a private party boat.. oh and an awesome ride somewhere in there.&nbsp; &nbsp;But as a warning, you are going to not shower or sleep for an entire weekend.&nbsp; There are going to be a lot of crusty awesome moped people.&nbsp; You will get hit on a lot because you will be in the girl moped minority.&nbsp; <br /><br />But it s a hell of a lot of fun.

				So, as per the semi-planning discussion we had tonight:<br /><br />I&#39;m not comfortable taking my van to Austin -- it&#39;s broken down twice in the last 3 weeks. If it runs properly between now and then, and at the last minute we are left with no other choice, I will take it, but I&#39;d rather not have to do that. <br /><br />I know some of you were discussing rental vehicles. I don&#39;t think this is a feasible solution -- we can&#39;t afford mileage on a Uhaul, we can&#39;t tow a trailer with a rental vehicle, and we can&#39;t fit 10 mopeds into a rental van (or afford to have the gas smell removed afterwards). If someone can find a big Uhaul-like truck that we don&#39;t have to pay mileage on, then that might be the start of a plausible solution.<br /><br />That leaves us with Brett&#39;s Jeep and Kenden&#39;s van. Ashley and Daryl are going in Ashley&#39;s car, and they can take 1 bike. That leaves me, Brett, Kenden, Spencer, Chris, Becca, Ed, and Trinity (if I&#39;m forgetting anyone or if anyone had a change of heart, now&#39;s a good time to speak up) -- so 8 people, and 9 bikes, some of which are large bikes. Between those two vehicles, people space shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Moped space, though ... that will be tough. We need one trailer that can haul 9 mopeds, including a MB5 and Ed&#39;s Passport, assuming he&#39;s bringing it. If we split the gas for those two vehicles and one trailer rental (est. $100) between 8 people, it works out to about $110 per person. I think all of us would like to leave Thursday night, so Ed, is that doable for you? I know you said at one point that you don&#39;t get off until 2:30 in the morning or something. I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;d all rather leave earlier than that, but we can talk and try to get something figured out. <br /><br />At this point, anyone who drops will decrease the cost splitting without increasing efficiency, because if we have more than 3 people going, we&#39;re going to need both vehicles. So please guys, if you want out, say so now before things get any more finalized.

				I have been looking at craigslist for bigger trailers.&nbsp; Mine has been abused by you people for far too long and I doubt it will make it to Austin if we have to end up using it.. which I hope we dont because unless we pile bikes we they are not going to fit.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If I do invest the money in a new tailer I am going to start charging you guys a trailer tax every time I have to haul you bikes to a rally.&nbsp; Trailers are expensive and the ware on my poor jeep is getting to it.&nbsp; I&#39;ll keep you posted on buying, borrowing, steeling, a trailer on my end.&nbsp; However, I&#39;m in NYC this weekend which dosent leave much time or room to dick around with getting things figured out for ACR.

				I think a trailer tax is legit, unless everyone wants to pitch in to buy the trailer in the first place. Even paying you a trailer tax would be cheaper than renting one for the weekend (which is already included in my cost spreadsheet, and it&#39;s now looking like $110 per person). If you do get a trailer, let me know how much you want added to cost spreadsheet for it. If you see a trailer that you want me to check out/get, lemme know. I could probably swing buying a semi-cheap trailer in the short term, assuming I got paid back before the rally and assuming it didn&#39;t live at my house.

				7 people, but 8 bikes. Even if Spencer took two people and two bikes, we can&#39;t fit 5 people and 6 bikes into one vehicle, so we&#39;re still better off taking in the two good hauling vehicles even if they do get lousy gas mileage.

				I tried calling both sets of parents and no go on either of their trailers.&nbsp; So at this point I would say we are pretty much going to have to go U haul.&nbsp; Can someone call and get rates so we can began to figure out how much it is going to cost each of us?&nbsp; Also who is pulling the trailer?

				Brett, give Ray a call. He&#39;s definitely NOT going to the rally and won&#39;t need his trailer that weekend. It will haul all your bikes and is in good condition. You will be out of there in 5 minutes and on your way...

				His number is on the phone list. I really, really, really hate calling people though (like, everyone, universally), so I don&#39;t really want to call, though. <br /><br />I could go down to Uhaul sometime this week after work too, if that would be easier. Brett, you&#39;d probably have to come with me though, because I&#39;m not a good judge of how many moped we can put in a certain size trailer.

				Did you guys get Becca&#39;s bike sorted.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t have time to put the carb on and I couldn&#39;t find my 60&#39;s jets, but the pipe is a go.&nbsp; Lets get that thing properly tuned so her first rally isn&#39;t from the view of the brake down bus.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also she had mentioned that we might be able to use her mom&#39;s ford expedition, its much bigger then my jeep with a bigger engine... so it would pull more, get better gas milage, and it dosen&#39;t have a soft top so whoever ride&#39;s in it to austin dosen&#39;t have to be deft by the time they get there.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, its just a rummer at this point I don&#39;t know if its a real offer or not. <br /><br /><br />2 other things, my parents are nice, and ED. when are you getting off work on Thursday?<br /><br />I would really like to get things on the road as early as possible.&nbsp; If I have all my shit together and loaded I can bring whatever trailer with me to lawrence after I get off work.&nbsp; That puts me in Lawrence around 7.&nbsp; I can go to Daryl&#39;s&nbsp; or somewhere so we can meet up, load up, and go south to pickup Ed.&nbsp; That being said, we also need to think about the return trip... last year we dropped Ed off, then dropped the lawrence crew off, then I had to drive Justin to blue springs, then back to KC for me.... That fucking sucked... especially after driving 14hrs on a hangover and having to unload / reload the trailer at each stop going and cuming.&nbsp; Basically I went home showered, and had to go straight to work.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Part 2... My parents are lovely people and I was wondering If we could rest stop at their house for Brunch on Friday and for showers on Sunday. Their place is right off of I-35 and my mom is a good cook. If we leave Lawrence by 10:00 = that puts us in Waco with amble stop time by 9am.&nbsp; its only 2 more hours to austin from waco. <br /><br />

				Do we need to do an assessment of who can drive stick+trailer to help figure out who goes in which car (assuming we take your Jeep)? No matter how awesome you are at driving when you&#39;re on empty, it doesn&#39;t seem like a good idea to let you drive all the way there and back. <br /><br />If your parents are up for it, it would be really nice to get a rest stop there. If we leave Thursday night before midnight, we&#39;ll be getting in to Austin around noon, and I don&#39;t know how much we&#39;ll be able to do at that time anyway. It&#39;d be nice to show up a little later, better fed, and better rested. <br /><br />The return trip shouldn&#39;t be so bad this year, should it? I mean, yeah, we&#39;ll have to drop Ed off. Then we&#39;ll (you&#39;ll) have to drop Lawrence people off. After that, you can just go home, though.

				Ray brought his trailer over last night.. its big... 5x8, which dosen&#39;t seem that big, but its rated to haul several tons on cargo so its beefy, good for hi-way use, but if we are using my jeep its going to be slow because that thing is heavy.&nbsp; Also, lets plan&nbsp; to not get stuck in shitty shitty bumper to bumper traffic in Dallas and Austin, because stoping this thing is going to be a bitch. <br /><br />That being said, the man is graciously letting us use his trailer.&nbsp; As thanks I wanted to give him something and we settled on a nice hs50 top tank or a u-lock trailer lock that goes through the wheels.&nbsp; I think that is beyond fair since we are going to put 1600 miles on his trailer. <br /><br />ALSO:&nbsp; bring gas money because linda will be keeping track.&nbsp; I will leave you and your moped on the side of the highway if you dont pitch in. <br /><br />ALSO:&nbsp; Straps, i need to buy more because all mine are brokenish, so if you have ratchit straps bring them to the meeting point.

				Okay, gas calculations are here:<br /><br />https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AseU2kk9COgXdHNwalNlUUFiVFJnYnFvVVBISHNhcEE&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0<br /><br />I calculated based on Kenden&#39;s van getting 20mpg and Brett&#39;s Jeep getting 10. Gas @ $3.50/gallon, 700 miles each way. That puts total gas money at $735, so divided between 7 of us, that&#39;s $105 per person. PLEASE BRING $110 CASH MONIES WITH YOU WHEN WE LEAVE. If there&#39;s any left over, you&#39;ll get some back, but I like to round up. It&#39;s much easier to get money out of everyone before we leave than it is to try and get money out of people when we&#39;re all home and we need to pay someone back. If for some reason you cannot bring cash with you, paypal me before we leave, and I&#39;ll put the cash in for you. <br /><br />Kenden, I hate to say it, but we can&#39;t leave before Ed gets off work, and Ed gets off at 2:30. If we&#39;re completely ready to go at that point and we don&#39;t stop at Brett&#39;s parent&#39;s house, that puts us in Austin around 3 in the afternoon. So, realistically, figure 5pm. At the earliest. If it&#39;s that big of an issue, we can split up, but since Brett&#39;s hauling all the mopeds, everyone in your van will arrive well before their mopeds arrive. Or, well ... there are 7 of us. Put 3 in Brett&#39;s Jeep, and that leaves your van with just 4. You&#39;d know better than I, but I bet you can fit at least one moped in the van with 4 people, and that would help keep the trailer less crowded. If you wanna split early and take a bike or two, knock yourself out. Just make sure everyone in your van knows that they&#39;ll be in Austin without mopeds for a few hours.
