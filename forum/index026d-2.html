			&nbsp;I&#39;ve been trying to figure this out. when the weather gets warmer, the molecules in the air spread out, and to maintain a ratio, lets say 15 to 1 , air to gas, one would need to jet down,,, inversely as the weather chills, the molecules pack together, and a smaller jet would make the ratio right. Right? so picture a small spring, becomes a creek, then a stream, and then feeds into a river, and then rivers, and oops, here comes a cliff, Lets&#39; get into a barrel, and ride over, NO No, lets, get on moped and ride to KC.... so anyway,,, we need a rocket sceintist to verify this, perhaps only to point out that I have it exactly backwards,,, but my contention is. Small springs make big Falls.....smaller being a smaller jet.. and ..you know...... we need a poet to make a good one... a all good boys deserve fudge, like that......Mark

			Cold/winter means that the air is more dense, which means you need a bigger jet to compensate for more oxygen getting into the combustion mix.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t put in a bigger jet, you will run lean.<br /><br />Warm/summer means the air is less dense, so you need a smaller jet to compensate.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t put a smaller jet in you&#39;ll be running too rich.<br /><br />This is why my maxi runs better on the way to work in the morning (when it&#39;s cooler outside) than it does when I head home at 4:30 when it&#39;s all warm out.&nbsp; It&#39;s also why our bikes seem to run shittier in summer.
