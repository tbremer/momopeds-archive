				Yeah, I dun did it!<br /><br />Running about WOT,&nbsp; 59!GPS TOP SPEEED, down a steep ass hill, then shimmy, and it felt like my chain popped, I had throttle, yet no response, so I easily coast up the other side, pull over and notice I have a chain, but alas! It must be the clutch, its been shimming off the take off since I got that bike..yeah sure enough when I pull into engage, no engage. CLUTCH WORLD FOR ME NOW!<br /><br />

				Shit, you&#39;re now the fastest moped in StL, dude!&nbsp; Did that 80cc monster eat the clutch already, or do you think it&#39;s just loose?

				Just got back from the wedding, I think it ate a plate or something, it turns and just dont engage..if I knew what the hell about a clutch, I might be able to fix it...I posted on MA several times ,but they dont know shit about a Sachs...

				Jimmy, I was all distracted doing shit yesterday.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t get to hear the full story.&nbsp; So what happened?&nbsp; Is it gonna happen again?&nbsp; I don&#39;t know how Sachs clutches work.&nbsp; Are they like a Puch?

				I&#39;m still learning but its not like a Puch...puchs are shoe clutches..this is a shim clutch...therefore there are tolerances to deal with..i think I finally got it right...the retaining nut&nbsp; seems to come off at high speeds...but I&#39;m just not going balls to the wall until I figured out...

				I&#39;ve been there too, shimmed clutchs are a tricky beast at times, I hope you get this figured out.<br /><br />Are the RPMs just too much for it? How worn are the plates? So the use metal or rubber for shims?

				Nah its not worn much at all, it just spins the retaining nut off at high rpm&#39;s. It could be the cranshaft being slightly untrue, good enough for 40 mph bt not over 50! <br /><br />Yeah Ive been shimming away,and finally I may have it or something very close, it grabs strong off the throttle, and accellerates like a motorcycle, but now Im just afraid of the 50mph mark...im really sore from pushing this thing around town...alwasy with a full tank of gas no less.<br /><br />oh wait I should be doing homework, not working on peds all day and nite....<br /><br />&nbsp;???
