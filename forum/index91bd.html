				You don&#39;t need anything special to go really fast on a Hobbit. A pipe, some port work and a notched variator will get you to high-40s easily on all the stock parts. I can do all that, or give you decent instructions, buuuuuut the last time I offered you didn&#39;t want it so whatev.

				Well then I&#39;d hope you&#39;d be able to figure out the answer to your question from my response.<br /><br />Honestly, that kit doesn&#39;t need any modifications. You should get 60+ out of it given the right supporting mods. The stock Hobbit variator (or even the TJT for that matter) doesn&#39;t have the range necessary to get REALLY wild with port timings, without running into a whole mess of other problems.

				Mr. Knowitall? I don&#39;t think so. Just giving you an opinion. If you want to blow money on port work go right ahead, I&#39;m just telling you the difference isn&#39;t going to be huge.

				Nope, just basing my facts off the port map (degree timings and time-area make a kit really predictable) and what people have said before.<br /><br />The TJT, while it will give you a bit higher drive ratio, won&#39;t give you much lower drive ratio. The only functional difference is that it&#39;s really adjustable. The final range which is basically fixed (say from 5:1-10:1 gear ratio, I don&#39;t know what the actual numbers are) really isn&#39;t big enough to support really huge exhaust durations. You&#39;ll still see low rpm off the line, which can be fixed by clutch springs, but only to a certain extent (I had pretty wild springs on mine and still had issues). Midrange will be good depending on variator weight, and you&#39;ll see a higher top speed due to the higher rpm the cylinder is capable of; but the bike as a whole will be less rideable. It all depends on what you&#39;re willing to tolerate. But when people see really crazy insane speeds from the kit from the factory, why sacrifice? I&#39;ve got a TON of real world experience altering port maps. I won&#39;t call myself an expert, but I do notice trends. Like my ported stock cylinders, I was starting to get diminishing returns on increases in duration or time-area. Same sort of situation.
