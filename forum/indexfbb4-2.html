				Who&#039;s going? Let&#039;s organize this, it&#039;s going to be a LOT of fun.&nbsp; It&#039;s a summer rally (so no driving in a blizzard) and it&#039;s the national &quot;official mopedarmy&quot; rally for this year! I need to make this and hope other people are into going from Columbia.&nbsp; It&#039;s going to easily be the best rally of the year...&nbsp; Depending on my finances at the time I can throw down more than my fair share on the gas ... if possible.&nbsp; Otherwise, I can definitely pitch in my fair share on the gas and help with lodging.<br />

				I am planning on going, my cousin moved to Denver this year, definetly be fun to get up there for a ride. I need to get a new clutch in my truck, after that it would be good to haul a few peds, technically has seatbelts for 5 very uncomfortable people.

				Declan, depending on who ends up going from here ... if nobody goes I would definitely like to catch a ride with you.&nbsp; I can drive and pitch on gas, but I would for sure like to catch a ride with buddies locally if anyone ends up going.
