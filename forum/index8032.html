				^ yep. They didn&#39;t say I could ride, but they also didn&#39;t say I couldn&#39;t. So as far as I&#39;m concerned, that means I&#39;m allowed to ride. I have 3 working mopeds -- it&#39;s time to start breaking them. Let&#39;s all go ride &#39;till our balls fall off. <br /><br />I&#39;m busy tomorrow and part of Sunday, so maybe after 4 on Sunday afternoon? It&#39;s supposed to be 85 and sunny. Who&#39;s in? <br /><br />

				Actually, I think I liked the Free Spirit best. Don&#39;t tell that to any of the other mopeds, though. They might be mad at me if they found out. <br /><br />And yeah, you bought Bryan&#39;s Swinger this last weekend.
