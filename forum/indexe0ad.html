				Starting now and for the next 12 hours + it is Joyride Time. I will be riding all over O&#39;Fallon / St. Charles area. If anyone wants to ride lets meet up. I am game for any mundane task. Just make a post if you want to ride or call me Steve @ 636 two88 one88two. I like to stop in at about every Pawn Shop, Goodwill, &amp; Salvation Army looking for deals. What do you like to cruise to on your mopeds?

				No plans, just had the day free. But I think I may try to set up another day to ride soon. So keep you eyes peeled and be ready to roll out! Taking my 14 year old nephew for a ride today. Hopefully the cops don&#39;t pull us over.

				We got pulled over for being in a new park that hadn&#39;t opened yet. I said&quot; so we should go then&quot; he said &quot;yes&quot; so I hit the gas and rode off before it escalated. Think my nephew is hooked on mopeds. He said it&#39;s 100x better then his bike.

				Mopeds and Scooters are not against the law in lake St. louis. BUT they are not allowed on the Meadows shoping center.&nbsp; &nbsp;The HR has worked really hard at building good relationships with the different police departments in st charles county by riding safe and obeying all laws. Be careful having an no liscensed person ride a moped on the streets its a serious offense if he gets caught.&nbsp; Be safe!&nbsp; :)

				Well the Lake St. Louis cops didn&#39;t even know who the Holly Rollers where when I asked. And be prepared to be pulled over for just crossing a state highway while on a normal road that intersects it.&nbsp; This is a crime in there eyes. Wish my tax money actually went to cops that stop crimes.
