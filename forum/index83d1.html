				What up guys, let me introduce myself. People call me, mighty mike. Holdin down the scene in Raytown with a few like minded, wrench twistin&#39;, double fistin&#39;, hard hittin individuals.We meet at the Irish pub hose off Raytown rd every Wednesday and Saturday formally, and whenever we can really. Anyhow, I roll a 77 fmb yankee peddler, 15 milli Dell because I was broke at the time... With a super stupid crazy Zen pipe. V1 motor of course. My crank case loosened itself, and in turn, caused it to run lean, which caused something in the crank case to freeze up. Pulled the whole motor apart and can&#39;t find the culprit. Super bummed, no one can figure it out. Piston is fine, motor isn&#39;t seized. Anyway, mopeds are my life... I live and bleed for them. If anyone would like to take some time to look at it, I would be happy to buy beer, BBQ or just give you dollars. I feel like I lost a family member and I get depressed when I hear weed eaters. Please help. I&nbsp; have a grave yard of parts that you can help yourself to as well; mostly minarelli ish. Thanks folks 816-316-9249.

				Sorry man, I don&#39;t really know V1&#39;s. Pay no mind to the Beez, he&#39;s legend, with many seizes, crashes, and blasts to his credit. The travails of mere mortals pale in comparison to the challenges of the free canoes of Chicago. However back to your issue, if you have eliminated the obvious, it is something else. Look deeper, remember the five: air, fuel, spark, compression, and timing.

				I guess i&#39;m confused.&nbsp; You said the crank case came apart and caused something to seize up but then you go on to say that nothing is seized up??? Which is it? So you split your case and the crank LOOKS fine... is there back and forth play in the conrod? excessive side to side play? can you spin the bearings freely with your hand ... is there any noise when spinning them? if you have the case split you may as well just rebuild it at this point, no sense in putting it back together with old bearings and seals.<br /><br />I can re-assemble it for you with new bearings and seals for a price if ALL THE SHIMS are in their CORRECT place still.

				Yeah there was still oil in it. We have another V1 that were currently comparing with. I was bent outta shape and typing too fast. The case seems fine, not cracked, no excessive play or anything, but the bearings are locked up somehow. I dunno, I&#39;ll be hitting up treatland for all new bearings and seals tonight. All the shims are where they should be and I&#39;d be happy to pay you for your time. I&#39;ll make a post when they get here and go from there. Im off weekends and usually home by 5 on weekdays if you wanna take a look at what&#39;s going on. Thanks again. I also have a truck that we can fit three bikes in if anyone needs help getting from point a to point b. Always willing to help out

				if the shims that are inside the motor are not in the right place I won&#39;t rebuild it hahaha I hope you kept them together in their right spots!<br /><br />the crank will not be cheap it&#39;s like $80 + $135 to get it assembled by a pro

				Some of us are in KC too, and I&#39;d imagine that&#39;s closer since that&#39;s where your profile says you live. Next time I hear about a ride/fix-it, I&#39;ll try to remember to shoot you a message.
