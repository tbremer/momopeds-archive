				alright, so i have this yellow pinto in great shape, got it from brystheguy non-running and ratty as hell, took it completely apart and cleaned each piece pretty meticulously and put together a little engine for it. its a beautiful beautiful bike, but i have like 5 bikes id probably rather do something with before this one, so i&#39;m gonna be realistic and practical and trade it away, if somebody has the right stuff. what i&#39;m really looking for is a totally rebuilt,case-matched, Gila&#39;d E50. polini&#39;d E50 would work too. whatever. just make me an offer or something. i&#39;m not really interested in any mopeds without titles, we need them in iowa and i have plenty without already. unless its something really fucking cool, then maybe i&#39;d be interested. cash offers also accepted, just make me an offer of some sort and we can work something out.<br /><br />so, the bike in question:<br /><br />(//hphotos-snc3.fbcdn.net/hs145.snc3/17260_229478277729_501292729_3087343_469425_n.jpg)<br />(//hphotos-snc3.fbcdn.net/hs125.snc3/17260_229478282729_501292729_3087344_6072218_n.jpg)<br />(//hphotos-snc3.fbcdn.net/hs125.snc3/17260_229478317729_501292729_3087346_3757670_n.jpg)<br /><br />heres everything i can tell you:<br /><br />like i said, i completely stripped the bike bare and cleaned every piece. the thing looks amazing and is on display inside my dads heated garage where we hang out a lot. the tank has really really minor pitting in the chrome near the forks and a scratch on the right hand side, but overall it looks really nice. rims have a little rust. i simplified the wiring, but the brakelight switches still function, along with the speedometer light. bullet headlight with 40mph speedo (47 miles on the clock!...i may keep the bullet headlight though since its my only one left. your call.) brakes feel good (for a puch) frame has usual scratches and wear for its age but overall definitely the nicest pinto i&#39;ve ever owned. plus the yellow ones are my favorite (yes, even more than the black ones.)<br /><br />engine:<br />E50, stock crank, 50cc treats kit, port matched. about 45 miles on the kit. never soft-seized, looks perfect. 50cc hi-comp head. 15mm bing/intake with hi-flow filter. tecno boss. i&#39;ll re-gear it 16-45, right now it has an 18 tooth on it and its sluggish on takeoff. 3-shoe clutch with new arms. i put 10w-30 in the case and it seems like the clutch is slipping too much now so i&#39;ll re-fill it with ATF. i had this engine on my maxi and its a solid 39-40mph setup. not a huge fan of this kit but i think with some porting and a complete rebuild it&#39;d be a little faster.<br /><br />in any case this is a solid little commuter bike, fun to ride and it looks amazing. i&#39;m up for any offers, so please just let me know what you have in mind. bry was supposed to be getting me a title for it but im not sure if he got the wheels in motion. i&#39;ll ask him whats up.<br />if you want more pics/info lemme know!<br /><br />thanks.<br />
