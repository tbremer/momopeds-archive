The spot we have picked out is great its right off the lake/river and is a 15-20 min drive to down town lawrence! so yea if you have a day or so off come hang out, pretty sure we will be having a long ride around the lake!.

				Woot! <br /><br />And I dunno if you&#39;re looking for ways we can entertain ourselves, but this could be combined with the cheesy sweater/pumpkin ride. Put on cheesy sweaters, ride to pumpkin patch, see who can get biggest/most pumpkin home on moped .... carve pumpkins, maybe? Just a thought. Keeping it separate for the sake of having more rides is dandy too.

				Yes, good time to bump this. I want a roll call.<br /><br />Mid-Mo guys, I saw that some of you are going to try to come. This makes me very happy. IRE, I know you&#39;re 5 hours away and that you might not have seen this until now (if you see it now), but we&#39;d love to see all your happy smiling faces again. Chuck, Matt, Jamie? I heard you all aren&#39;t coming? :( You gotta do what you gotta do, though. If Andrew wants to come but doesn&#39;t have a ride, I&#39;ll drive over to KC and pick him up. Ed? You coming?

				We need to have plates and be registered, but so long as you&#39;ve got a MO driver&#39;s license, you should be good (a printout of MO laws wouldn&#39;t hurt, though). I&#39;ve been riding around on the Tomos for two weeks with my tool case blocking my license plate, and I haven&#39;t been stopped yet. We don&#39;t have a helmet law, but you should bring one anyway because we would feel bad if you broke your head while riding at our rally without a helmet. <br /><br />We have McDonald&#39;s. Doesn&#39;t McDonald&#39;s have coffee now? Do you like McDonald&#39;s coffee?

				its been a while since i posted cause i couldnt log in for a while idk why maybe im dumb. but heres the scoop fellas (and ladies) due to outrageous camping fees and alot of people cancelling we are moving the camping from the lake to my girlfriends backyard in town LOL i know it kinda sucks but nevertheless we will still be camping and we will ave access to a garage. p.s. we are doing a cheesy sweater ride so do bring heinous sweaters. Other than that all is going as planned and I hope to see you all soon!!! LATER

				You know, I went to Goodwill the other day, and their selection of cheesy sweaters was sadly lacking. There were maybe MAYBE two that were appropriately hideous, and I don&#39;t remember either of them being the right size. It was disappointing.

				Just a note to everyone coming: it looks like it&#39;s going to be rather cold this weekend -- like, highs below 50, and lows into the freezing range. Dress warm.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.ljworld.com/weather/&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; the weather report I usually look at.
