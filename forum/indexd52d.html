				Is anyone really good at drilling and tapping shit? cuz apparently I am not and I don&#39;t want to fuck up my Athena kit anymore than I have. Or at least does someone have a decent metric tap and die set that I can use Sunday?<br /><br />Drilled and tapped m10 -&gt; cut bolts and tapped m6 into the middle-&gt; forgot to measure distance between the studs...way too close together and not strait at all...<br /><br />On the up side I was getting no low end out of the stock e50 because the compression was shit. Slapped on K-Star, and now way better than I thought. so until I can get a stock piston (or new rings) I&#39;ll be rock&#39;n the cheap-o kit.

				I think it&#39;s something like if you break it, don&#39;t fuck with it, just bring it to a metal shop and they&#39;ll fix it for like $10.<br /><br />If you fuck around with it, then bring it to them, they charge you like $25.&nbsp; haha

				No, definitely not.&nbsp; haha<br /><br />Actually, I think it may have been as much as $40 to fix it...it was like 3 years ago.<br /><br />I did learn not to fuck up studs though.&nbsp; :P

				Um, where is a machine shop I could take it to?&nbsp; Ideally, I would want to have someone pull out all the fucked up shit I did, weld the holes up, and re-tap for new studs...probably more than $40 worth of work though.

				I have always pulled the studs on the kits and gone over to allen head screws. They are harder, don&#39;t back out as easily, and less likely to strip out. Helicoil is your friend when used with in conjunction with a drill press.

				I&#39;ll bring it tonight and use the drill press to get the holes all strait and such.&nbsp; I think someone said there was a stud puller around.
