				Yeah its rideable but not as safe as it could be. Lots of rocks/sand, mud and weeds to be cleared. Its a small track but once you have to clean it up it is a BIG project. It will be shaping up by spring, rally ready!

				Hey guys! I haven&#039;t posted here in forever. Just moved back to Lawrence and can&#039;t wait to hang. Been working (slowly) on a korado build. Freespirit frame welded with a crossbar, general tank, korado with 65cc Hero cylinder on it. still need a lot more parts, but hopefully by summer it will be done! <br /><br />(//24.media.tumblr.com/e82ac2c4d51e7b5f7fa075fced82f987/tumblr_mxtq0xucHk1qgdl62o1_500.jpg)
