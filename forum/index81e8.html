			I was just informed about a ride tomorrow to Blue Springs Lake. We are leaving at 2 pm from 1000 West 25th, KCMO 64108. The Blue Springs lake route is AWESOME (Thanks Raytown crew)!! The weather is supposed to be perfect. This will be a great opportunity for any and all riders to help grow the moped community in the greater KC area.
