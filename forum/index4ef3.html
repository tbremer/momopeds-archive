				yeah, they got out wednesday morning,, back gate, I know I had seen them, within 10 minutes,,, I sent the boys out on their bikes to look,, no sign anywhere,,,, they&#39;ve been pretty good when they get out, sniffing in the alley, and staying in ear shot, for the most part,,, auggie had just said the day before, we should put tags on their collars, they&#39;re chipped, but we checked at the pound, humane society, and animal rescue,, natta,,,I think someone lured them into a car,,,I hope they&#39;re all right///

				Glad to see you got them back. Yeah, I tried, but they wouldn&#39;t come close. Kinda strange because I spent an hour earlier that day trying to lure in a stray downtown, also to no avail.
