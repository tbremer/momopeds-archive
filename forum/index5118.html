				Its frustrating to have a kitted bike that you never go WOT on because you are in constant feer of overheating.&nbsp; I love the Grand Prix, but having to look down at the temp gauge every hundred yards really takes the fun out of riding.&nbsp; &nbsp;Basically the Gila Peugeot kit has fins that are too small to adequately cool itself because the French race boys want their kitted bikes to appear stock.&nbsp; &nbsp;On top of that when you are blasting the engine variates to a position that blocks air from passing over the fins effectively.&nbsp; Currently my riding temps are around (360 - 380, 30-35mph)&nbsp; (380 - 400, 35-40mph)&nbsp; (400 - 435+, ~ 45 to 50mph)&nbsp; the bike can go a lot faster but I cant ever open up the throttle because the temp skyrockets in to the danger zone.&nbsp; <br /><br />**Attention Justin and all the other tuning gods**&nbsp; I know I am not the best at high end tuning but I have messed around to the best of my ability with jetting, needles, and timing.&nbsp; Currently I am running an MVT CDI that starts at 1.3 and has a nice retarded curve.&nbsp; The needle is on the second position and I am running a 92 main jet.&nbsp; So lets just say that the bike it tuned as good as it gets for now and I can&#39;t dump anymore heat with tuning.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />My Solution!&nbsp; Take a page from Minarili&#39;s and make the 103 forced air-cooled.&nbsp; &nbsp; I spent some time in the basement this weekend and came up with a mockup.&nbsp; Its built on&nbsp; a v1 shroud backing, the small version, which happens to fit perfectly onto the 5 coil 103 stater plate.&nbsp; I taped the holes of the MVT CDI and mounted a fan from a Marini.&nbsp; &nbsp;On all that I made a card bord mockup of the potential fan housing which I will make out of sheet metal sometime this week.&nbsp; Hopefully it can bring the temperatures down 30ish degrees.

				Some sheet metal and welding will be way easier (IMO) than fiberglass.

				I like this.<br /><br />The only problems I see are:<br /><br />-without a shroud, only the right side of the cylinder will be getting fan cooled (uneven cooling, maybe an issue?), and it&#39;ll only work when you&#39;re stopped. When you&#39;re moving, the forced air would probably disrupt the fan air. This might or might not cause problems, what do you think?<br />-WITH a shroud, the whole cylinder would be fan-cooled (same config as every air cooled scooter ever), but all forced air from moving would be gone, so you&#39;d be relying solely on the fan; and if you don&#39;t give it ENOUGH air, obviously you&#39;ll run into problems. I&#39;ve read about this happening a lot with H-Minarelli scooters - they kit and the stock fan isn&#39;t able to keep it cool enough.<br /><br />But it looks really solid and I&#39;d like to see this materialize.

				Looking back at the pictures I posted it is missing a section of the fan housing that goes across the bottom of the cylinder.&nbsp; &nbsp;My plan it to box in the cylinder and leave the head exposed, simular to the v1 design.&nbsp; That way the cylinder that isn&#39;t geting air anyway when it is variated can get some flow and the head can get its normal cooling by convential air flow. <br /><br />Justin has a valid point about uneven cooling thought.&nbsp; Unlike the Minarelli cylinders the Gila kit has a much thicker cylinder wall and variable fin thickness.&nbsp; That might mean that air from the fan might not flow around the cylinder effectively and only one side will be cooled.&nbsp; <br /><br />But no point in not trying it out.&nbsp; I am going so a aluminum fiberglass composite, making the parts that touch the cylinder out of aluminum and the rest out of fiberglass.&nbsp; I should have some progress photos by tomorrow.&nbsp; But I would still like to get your opinions.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I think a bit more material needs to be placed near the exhaust to move more air over the bottom half of yr cylinder... Basically do on the bottom what you did on the top. <br />When you siezed in the past where did you see the problems? Concentrate on cooling there...

				What scooter mentioned about fiberglass is for sure way easier than using the mesh. Still a fucking pain, and sanding it sucks.<br /><br />If you could create a shroud that went all around the cylinder, and used the fan to suck air from the front (forgive me if that is already what it does...) it would work, no? <br /><br />There are also low power fans that could be run off of the electrics. Meaning you could create the shroud with a fan on either side, constantly pulling in air through the fins. So, there would be no issues of uneven cooling.<br />

				this is an awesome idea, but I would think that instead of an air shroud an air duct sort of design with the fan pointing towards the middle of the head would have a better effect on the varied fin thicknesses, and this way you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about loosing your forced air cooling as well.<br /><br />You could hook the fan up to a switch this way too, so you could have forced air assist will riding WOT, or somewhere close to it, and have the option to turn it off at stoplights or what have you, if it blows hot air on your legs.

				Last night I went to ACE and looked around for things that I could hack up to make this fan shroud.&nbsp; I found a large diameter snap pip fitting, some aluminum sheet, fiberglass risen, cloth, and randome hardware. I took it all home and made the basic form that I will coat with fiberglass tonight<br /><br />The fan housing is made out of the snap fitting, which is cut on the sides to inset two long nuts which will be bonded to the fitting with some glass work.&nbsp; The parts that touch the cylinder are made out of the sheet aluminum and will get fiberglass laid on to parts of it and then rivits run through once its hardened for extra support. <br /><br />

				Ideally you would want the scoop to have a larger cross sectional area than the motor you are trying to cool.&nbsp; So if the frontal area of the cylinder is 100cm squared then shoot for 150 or 200 cm squared for the scoop front.&nbsp; &nbsp;As the air passes by the engine, giving a little room for blow by around the fins will allow for plenty of flow without needing too much pressure.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would just measure the fins and give 1/2 that around the engine for airflow.&nbsp; So if the fins are 10mm deep, I would make the scoop sit 5mm away from the engine fins.&nbsp; <br /><br />An aluminum shroud/ scoop will transfer more heat than a glass one.&nbsp; It will transfer radiant heat&nbsp; where it is close to the block and give a larger surface area for dissipation.&nbsp; If you wanted to really step it up, add cooling fins to the shroud too.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Can you take a side pic of the engine in low and high variation?

				Last night I took Holms advice and added scoops to either side of the cylinder.&nbsp; &nbsp;This might disrupt some of the airflow produced by the fan at higher speeds, but will probably be better at cooling down both the cylinder and head.&nbsp; Also someone mentioned focusing the cooling efforts on the areas I have siezed before.&nbsp; Well that would be exhaust side, so I will probably be adding a third scoop tonight.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I won&#39;t have time to fiberglass it before WB4, so I might just coat it in 10,000 layers of duct or aluminum tape and see how it works at the rally. <br /><br />What do you think?

				Yeah!&nbsp; &nbsp;I would say you could pull the scoops closer to the block and then give some exit ports too, but you should probably just try it as-is and see how the temps fair.&nbsp; &nbsp;Better to make and test than be a keyboard jock about it like me :D<br /><br />If I were to make one I would have the main scoop pull air from the bottom front mostly and force it to go with the angle of the fins.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like this hack job of a pic.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I&#39;ll move them in, but I was trying to pull air in from around the front wheel.&nbsp; How important is the closeness to the cylinder.&nbsp; In my logic, boxing it closer would trap heat instead of forcing air through.&nbsp;

				As long as there is room for air flow you can get the box right on it.&nbsp; Because of the cylinder fin angles you would have to ensure the intake and exit was proper to encourage flow.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Run what you have and see how it does.&nbsp; It is probably good enough if you have an exit for the hot air.&nbsp;
