				After working on this damn clutch for 4 months, I decided it was time to give the thing a pretty paint job. The rest of the bike isn&#39;t in too great of shape (yet) but since Garelli clutches are notorious for problems it seemed like a good place to start.<br /><strong>Don&#39;t forget to save that used ND30 Oil for your stir fry.</strong><br />(//i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u373/dukeswift1/garelliped/01bike_zpsb3929682.jpg)<br /><br />Here&#39;s the clutch (use rivets, for your health)<br />(//i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u373/dukeswift1/garelliped/02clutchzoom_zpseacb02a8.jpg)<br /><br />Step 1: Remove shitty paint, wear goggles and drunk<br />(//i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u373/dukeswift1/garelliped/03paintremoval_zps8050b501.jpg)<br /><br />Step 2: Sand, sand primer primer primer sober<br />(//i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u373/dukeswift1/garelliped/04clutchprimer_zps260fda04.jpg)<br /><br />Step 3: Paint 4 coats (used a white paint pen for the letters) and get all them inhalant particles YUM<br />(//i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u373/dukeswift1/garelliped/05clutchpaintblack_zps28054424.jpg)<br /><br />Step 4: A wild Fruit Stripe has appeared! Level Up!<br />(//i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u373/dukeswift1/garelliped/06clutchfruitstripe_zps65efe05d.jpg)<br /><br />Step 5: (Not pictured) Clear coat sexy :D and let it sit for a week :(<br />

				Whoah it looks so new and special! Where did all that metal go?! There was a guy who claimed to have had it before Kevin but I can&#39;t remember his name. Runs great after some clutch work, can handle about 30 to 40 mile trip with no problems at all! Usually stop for a smoke to let it cool down.That other VIP looks pretty sick too! Going to Bondo and repaint the tank today, will post a photo afterwards!

				Haha! The side covers are rad but I&#39;m going to try and strip as much unnecessary weight as i can. See if I can&#39;t make it a race Garelliped, with some love and care. Seems like a good winter project.
