				http://www.mopedarmy.com/forums/discuss/2/243829/243748/ (http://www.mopedarmy.com/forums/discuss/2/243829/243748/)<br /><br />Summary: There&#39;s a moped somewhere in Ohio that Benji needs transported to LA. Some people seem to be offering to get it to St. Louis for the rally. If those people did that, (a) would we have room to get it back to KC, and (b) Kevin and Ed, would you have room to take it to LA with you?

				I *think* someone from the forums is taking it from Ohio to Chicago today. Then Ian is bringing it from Chicago to St. Louis. Or that seems to be the plan from what I&#39;m reading on MA, anyhow.

				No, I think he was the only volunteer for the Ohio to Chicago leg. Unless someone else can get it to Chicago or St. Louis before the rally, this might not happen :(

				The bike&#39;s in &quot;Cleveland 44105.&quot; I&#39;m sure we can e-mail the guy who was going to take it to Chicago for more specific information if we need it.

				FYI...If you can&#39;t find the polaroid camera...you can use a free program called Poladroid to turn any picture into a Polaroid looking one.&nbsp;
