			Calling all moped people, the time has come! Memphis is having our first ever moped rally and we want YOU to be there!!! April 24th-26th. Come join us for a weekend of blues and booze and don?t forget your dancing shoes. You snooze, you lose. Come find out why we affectionately call it the Dirty South. <br /><br />Housing will be provided for the most part. I have a small unfurnished apartment upstairs from my house where plenty of people can sleep, bring a sleeping bag and be prepared to get familiar with your neighbor. Ryan and JR have a BIG backyard with plenty of room to pitch a tent if you?re into that kind of thing, we all know good things happen in tents. Or sleep in your car, that works too. If hotels are more your style, let us know and we?ll pass some info along to ya. <br /><br />Saturday?s ride will be a long one so make sure to tune your bike. There will be a chase vehicle Saturday and most likely Sunday just in case you break your moped. Bring your helmet because it?s the law and Memphis drivers suck and bring a lock because, well, it is the Dirty South. <br /><br />So what?s going down, you ask? Well?. <br /><br />Friday: <br />Arrive in Memphis. Check-in starts at 3:00pm at the Slider Inn (2117 Peabody Ave.) Get your rally pack and find out where you?re staying. Grab a bite to eat or a beer at Slider if you like, get settled into housing, fix your bike, explore the area, do your thing. At 6:00pm there will be a poker ride tour of a few of the local breweries, get a card at each stop, best hand wins a $50 gift certificate to Treats. End back at Slider?s for more schmoozin? and boozin?. At some point you should probably get some sleep, it?s a long ride tomorrow. Or don?t, I ain?t your daddy. <br /><br />Saturday: <br />Wake up and shake off that hangover. Your host will have some bagels and juice for you or you can try your hand at one of the many awesome local eateries, we?ll give you a map. Meet up at Overton Park at 11:00am and mingle with all your moped buddies for an hour, the ride won?t leave until 12:00pm. It?s gonna be a long ride (~65 miles) through Shelby Forest, then along the banks of the Mississippi, through the ghetto, and then back into Midtown. The ride will end at Slider?s. Go back to the house and unwind for a bit and then choose your own adventure for dinner. At 8:00pm we?ll meet up the Young Ave. Deli. Grab a beer, get loose, and enjoy some blues by the Cedric Burnside Project. Dance your butt off, play some fooseball, get krunk. Party like there?s no tomorrow. We own this town. <br /><br />Sunday: <br />Why did we party like there?s no tomorrow? Oh well, too late. Grab some more bagels and juice, hydration is key. Pack your shit and go home or stay longer, we?ve grown quite fond of you at this point. Sunday ride is a historical places ride (~26 miles) with a midway stop for brunch at Gus? Fried Chicken. Get back, decide what you want to do. If you want stay longer than Sunday we have to charge rent. Kisses, bitches, it?s been a blast. <br /><br />Registration: <br />To register, copy and paste this, fill it out, and send it to: iamcrkt@mopedarmy.com <br /><br />Name: <br />Phone # (optional): <br />Housing? (Y/N): <br />Gang/Club Affiliation (if any): <br />Rally Pack (Y/N): <br />Shirt size (S/M/L/XL/etc.):<br /><br />Rally packs are $15 before the rally, $20 at check-in.

			Looks like this isn&#039;t happening... getting moved to a later date.&nbsp; Too many official MA rallies in our area around the same time.
