				So I have a super old Raleigh from the 50&#39;s or 60&#39;s. It&#39;s got a super cool headlight that you can engage by clicking it onto the wheel and it runs on a generator. That&#39;s besides the point. The point is, I took it off of a substantial, but not ridiculously big, bump/jump. When I hit the ground, my &quot;Sturmey-Archer 3-speed hub gears, cable-controlled.&quot; got stuck in the third gear. <br /><br />Is it advisable to take apart the hub gears and try to fix it myself? I don&#39;t know anything about them, I can&#39;t see anything. Mostly because it&#39;s in the hub.<br /><br />Or do I take it to my friendly neighborhood bike shop? That costs $$$.

				Mark knows all about Sturmey Archer hubs.<br /><br />Annie has her mom&#39;s old Schwinn that has one.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t shift right, and I looked into rebuilding the hub...&nbsp; good luck.&nbsp; It&#39;s crazy in there.

				those hubs are insane, they have so many moving parts and gears and craziness. I would be so impressed if you rebuilt one.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know prices on getting on rebuilt, honestly why though? Get a fixed / flip flop relaced into your wheel. or I am sure you can find a new back wheel for cheap on local craigslist.<br /><br />S.A.

				holy shit I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t take that apart. Yeah, I&#39;m at school. I&#39;d definitely bring it over if I was around. So, what you&#39;re telling me, Mark, when you say &quot;the 43 won&#39;t go in the yadda yadda.&quot; Is that it can&#39;t be done?

				the shifter rod, has a chain on one end and its threaded on the other.&nbsp; The cable adjustment is hooked to that chain. The shift lever , up on the handlebars has 3 positions. With the shifter in &quot;3&quot; the cable is slack, and the wheel should be in &quot;3rd&quot;, or high gear. When you shift to &quot;2&quot;, the cable pulls the chain, pulls the shaft, pulls a pawl in the hub, and hold it in &quot;2nd&quot;. When you shift to &quot;1&quot;, it pulls it more, and hold it in the lowest gear.<br />&nbsp; I&#39;m building a Raleigh 3-speed just now, It&#39;s Red...google Raleigh bikes stuff, there&#39;s a site I like Harris somethin<br />&nbsp;Also i bought out the inventory from an old bike shop, and have tons of nos English stuff.<br />Do you have the bike up at school?

				right now it&#39;s stuck in &quot;3&quot; and the cable is the tightest. It gets slack when it&#39;s on &quot;1.&quot; Also, I can&#39;t get the lever to go back down. Yeah, the bikes at school. I got it for 40 bucks up here. I really like it. It&#39;s pretty heavy, though.
