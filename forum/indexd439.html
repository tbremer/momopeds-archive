				No more bloody eyes!<br /><br />I made some changes that are little too, my next bit is to fix the images, and make the &quot;post topic&quot; / &quot;reply&quot; look cleaner...<br /><br />Does anyone care about those smiley faces? How about centering text? I will probably leave the Bold, Italic, Underline, Strike, Image, Link, but other than that, I am getting rid of shit.

				Hey, can we make links in posts like a slightly different color?&nbsp; I keep going to copy and paste them, and being surprised that it&#39;s a link.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t have to be lame ol&#39; &quot;link blue&quot; color, but something would be good.&nbsp; Eh?<br /><br />Also, when you edit the code, do you do it all in cPanel like I usually do?

				Made it so you can have long fancy signatures<br /><br />Mike- I was trying to do that when you I made the forum really ugly with all red links. I am still working out how to make the post links different colors or perhaps bold without affecting the rest of the links on the page. And how do get into this &quot;Post Reply&quot; area so I can take out all of the obnoxious options. Simple Machines is weird!

				It&#39;s kind of funny, but I also don&#39;t know that its potential hilarity outweighs the potential damages. I&#39;m guessing that on most boards, you can applaud people who post good things and smite people who post bad things, and then newbies or whoever can see the kind of reputation someone has with other members and maybe how much to trust/take seriously the things that that person says. But here, we pretty much already all know each other, right? Or at least we already know everyone&#39;s online personalities. Do we really need to drive home the point with a rating system?&nbsp;

				It&#39;s broken, just a guess. ;-)<br /><br />No, seriously, did you upload this to the wikilou server or is it an external link? It&#39;s more than likely a path issue either way (Assumption) but I see the broken image link and I&#39;m on Win7 Enterprise with IE8<br /><br />

				The forum software will take almost any image type, except TIFF and BMP.<br /><br />But I know what works the best are JPG, PNG, and GIF.<br /><br />The upload image errors (and images not showing up) are a problem in the Beta software that we&#39;re using, I have tried a few different fixes that people suggested on the SMF forum, but nothing has worked yet.<br /><br />If you hot link an image it (usually) works, uploading seems busted for some reason.

				Not to detract from the image discussion, but I was just thinking about this and wondering if there&#39;s a reason we don&#39;t have a &quot;name&quot; spot in our profiles. I suppose most of us already know each other&#39;s names by now, but it might be a nice reminder of whose name goes with whose profile, or it could be useful to anybody new.

				personally i dont think its smart to put anything about the area in the name. mopeds yes but i just look at this site as not only a forum about crews in the area but its the site i goto because i dont like to ask questions on moped army. because sometimes they are dicks. and im sure alot of otherpeople feel the same, unless they are actually in moped army. long story short (its already long) i think other crews (maybe moped army rejects) may start to come to this site and maybe want to be a part of the forums themselves. They could be from anywhere in the country and it would kinda be weird if there was a group from like Washington who were on a MidWest moped site. i guess what im saying is lets be universal! just my 2 cents CHEERS!
