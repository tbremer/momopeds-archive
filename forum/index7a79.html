			Picked up a PA I 20mph version. Put a promo circuit on it, a DR kit, MLM intake and&nbsp; 18 Mikuni carb. Upgraded the 1 pedal reed block to a 2 pedal and put in some .35 carbon reeds. It is doing about 35-40 with my big ass on it atm. The belt is pretty lose atm, saw a video where a guy was saying it needed to be lose to engage more on the front variator. Then I saw another 1 where the guy said the belt needs to be tight to make the back variator engage. I am gonna fool with this today till I can get the back variator variating. I also purchases a TJT variator ramp plate and was going to install and see how it works. Was other videos of people notching the original variator ramp so the weights can engage it further, was going to try this with the original weights if the tjt is not impressive. Anyone have any other performance mods/ideas for the hobbits that I can do to them? Thanks

			You need the tjt variator as well. Are you running a pa50II variator plate? You should be in the upper 40&#039;s with that setup.

			PA I. Couldn&#039;t find anyone with a PA II to swap out. I hear the gearing is a little less but gotta work with what I got atm.

			Just tightened up the belt and got the back variator variating now and have more torque and some more speed. Gonna try and notch 3 windows in it without throwing it off balance and get some more top speed out of it.

			The pa50I plate is way less angled than the II. You need to cut and bend it or just go with the tjt.
