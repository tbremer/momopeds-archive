				For my new years present I am going to buy a nice tube bender.&nbsp; Been wanting one for years now, and it is the last purchase to make before I can start making for reals bike frames.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just sold off over $1000 of old toys on black friday, so I feel I can pick up something for myself in trade.&nbsp; <br /><br />What sizes/radius would be handy for exhaust?&nbsp; I was thinking 1&quot;, 1.5&quot;, and 2&quot; dies would be a good place to start for frames.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is the bender I will probably get, dies are at bottom&nbsp; http://www.jd2.com/shop/custom.aspx?recid=7&nbsp; The only problem is that most of them won&#39;t do thin wall .035&quot; stuff, but I think it is a function of the really tight radius bends the dies can pull.&nbsp; Guess we should be using thicker wall tubing anyway, right?

				Nice. I really need to watch you weld and learn sumthin. SO your saying we could make frames? lets build some 50cc full fairing salt flat bikes. Exhaust would be cool also. I have an idea for a shorter boss pipe for 50cc bikes.

				Once I finish up my notching jig there won&#39;t be anything we can&#39;t do.&nbsp; I have endmills to notch 1&quot; and 1.5&quot; tube currently.&nbsp; <br /><br />Headtube, downtube, rear suspension and engine mounts- that is all a frame is really.&nbsp; The rest is just tacked on hardware. <br /><br /><br />What OD size exhaust is commonly used?

				You honestly won&#39;t need a 2 inch die, only mopeds use 2 inch piping, cuz it&nbsp; the only support it has, most motorcycle frames are made out of more 1-1.5&quot; tubes with better geometry than the moped frame. So save yourself the $$$ on a 2 inch die until you find yourself actually needing one.

				guess who got it bolted on the bench and bent some test tubes tonight!&nbsp; &nbsp; Thinking about making some handlebars tonight since I don&#39;t have shit else to do besides work or study on a friday night.&nbsp; <br /><br />I may remount it, it is kinds akward how I have it, but it does work well.&nbsp; &nbsp;pics if I can get my phone to connect to my blog again. <br /><br /><br /><br />So making handlebars...<br /><br />Cut raw tube<br />mark centerline and bend lines<br />knurl the center<br />mark bend angles<br />bend 4 times<br /><br />and look at the hopefully beautiful piece of art.&nbsp; More than likely look at the crooked piece of shit the first few tries.

				Fuuuuuuck you bitchess!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Bent up a few sets of bars the other night with motivational/ handy help from Ryan.&nbsp; We couldn&#39;t get it 100% symetrical, but I have ridden on the bars shown and can&#39;t feel the few degrees of misalignment.&nbsp; Some changes to the bender and alignment markings will help remedy this in the future.&nbsp; More light would help too...<br /><br /><br />Ryan, we need to up the tube thickness for the next batch.&nbsp; I talked with jd2 about it, and there isn&#39;t much we can do otherwise with the current setup.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have spring break in a few weeks and will make sure I have more tubing here for practice.&nbsp;
