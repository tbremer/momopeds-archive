			Yeah yeah, we&#39;ll all put them on Facebook (you better, anyway), but let&#39;s put them here too. <br /><br />A summary:<br /><br />After donning cheesy sweaters, getting gas, and taking Mike back to get his Vespa (since the Pinto developed a lack-of-compression problem), we were on our way. We made it to the pumpkin patch without incident and acquired popcorn, cookies, and apple cider (seriously, that&#39;s the whole point in going). Some of us got pumpkins, but none of us had actually brought anything to tie them down with. Mine fell off the back of my moped in less than two miles. After that, we rode out to the overlook. Brett&#39;s Bat was going at least as fast as my Slowmos, which pissed me the hell off (stupid Tomos), although I was one of the few people who made it up the hill at the overlook without pedaling (yay Tomos!). <br /><br />Oh, and there were cheesy sweaters. Lots of cheesy sweaters. Some woman at the pumpkin patch said mine was the best... I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a good thing though, especially since everyone else had to go to the Salvation Army to get theirs, and mine came from my mom&#39;s closet... Also, I wore a cape. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

			I suppose Mike and Daryl already know about this, but for those of you who haven&#39;t seen this exchange, here&#39;s a little bit of lingering fun from the ride:<br /><br />http://lawrence.craigslist.org/rnr/1427176023.html<br /><br />http://lawrence.craigslist.org/rnr/1429303834.html

			If you push &quot;reply&quot; you can get his craigslist-ified email address. Someone start an email exchange with him so we can get his actual email address and let&#39;s sign it up for gay porno newsletters.

			seems to me that most people that get stuck waiting for a crew to pass, feel like they got to watch a &quot;free parade&quot;...nice retort, Mike
