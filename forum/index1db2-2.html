				the gas tank is in the frame. that&#39;s why the frame is capped off. ill make some gussets and other shit later.<br />i stretched the bottom of the frame and shortened the front so the bar hits the bottom of the head tube instead of the top. kinda bmx style

				not a fan of the tank raised up. I think the triple bump it makes, when lower, has a touch of a classic car feel. It just has an odd slope on the underside of the cross tube and tank as it is now.

				Okay, so before the criticism, this is beautiful! very bmx / bicycle styled. really clean. I love it!<br /><br />now, I think the tank would look nicer if it was a tad longer, and not so angled...<br /><br />more this:<br />(http://www.bornrich.org/images/self_decomposing_coffin.jpg)<br /><br />less this:<br />(http://iriox.com/beltbuckle/images/brianswholesale_2003_20185384.gif)<br /><br />that being said, i know anything will be amazing with your skillz.

				update: i made about 16 more pieces. the kids tore down the engine. i got everything together for a pb bath, switched the tires, hammered on the seat some more, greased the bearings, and put on the new brake pads. i also put that other yellow hobbit back together, then ditched it in the basement.<br /><br />i made a part last night, that took 1/2 hour to cut. then i ran over it with momma&#39;s van (shhh), that didn&#39;t work, then i jammed it into the brick wall and tried to jack it using a hydraulic floor jack, that didn&#39;t work............hmmm, i&#39;m walking in circles.... i carried this fence pole with 80 lbs of concrete attached into the garage, then another one.&nbsp; i jammed the piece into the heavy ends of the fence poles and lifted one side and started bouncing the concrete up and down. BINGO! it got about 1/2 way done then i finished by jamming it back into the brick wall and jacking then beating it with an axe. it was a pain in the ass and took about 3 hours, but man, when i put it on the moped....nice.<br />

				o.k.<br /><br />them rigid bars look pretty simple. ehh<br />lots of measuring and LOTS of cutting. it took about 3 hours to assemble after all that shit^^^^^ and a couple weeks of staring at it. the hardest part was to see this with the old arm in the way. <br />i have a few adjustments to do, and about 20 more pieces to cut. then a day of welding all this together. then another day of grinding and clean up. it might be ready in spring. i&#39;d guess it&#39;ll hold about 1 3/4 gallons of gas as is.

				this is lookin pretty solid, i&#39;m gonna take it all apart again and start from the ground up stripping, cutting off anything that ain&#39;ta staying on there, plugging holes, and welding it solid. i gotta check the rake on the forks again since i sat on it about 10 times and it fell over about 20. after that, i&#39;ll weld on some gusset plates to reinforce it, then weld the seat/gas tank on and together. hopefully by the time i&#39;m done with that, i have an idea for connecting the motor mounts and pedal shaft into the subframe. that pesky intake location has had me 2nd guessing every idea. then RK and JR are coming over to electrify it.<br /><br />hey stlers, i found a fabric store over by mike k&#39;s house that has marine vinyl. white, lt. gray, blue,green, red.

				i just remembered to take a pic of these headers side by side. the pipe is a proma circuit for a honda. the one i&#39;m holding was on there when i got it. the one on the pipe is a chair leg. it was a bitch to fit the new header in there and get it to lay down flat on the exhaust and connect to the chamber and get the original mounting holes to line up. look under my hand on the 2nd pic. after i put the new header on, i put a collar around the 2 sections to lock them together, cuz the proma steel is a little thinner than the chair leg header steel. i was running it at the &quot;safety meeting&quot;.<br /><br />we don&#39;t need no stinkin&#39; treats! ;,

				i&#39;ll take it apart and take some pics later.<br />&nbsp;this is how the pipe comes into the rectangle base plate. i cut the base plate first, using the rectangle hole size on the inside that the reed valve fits into and bolted it in place, the bolt pattern was from the original dio intake,, then held the intake pipe up to it at the angle i needed, eyeballed a line at the intersection of the 2 parts, hacked off the angle, held it up there again, tack welded the tip of the intake pipe in the center of the base plate hole, held the carb up about where it&#39;s gonna be on the end of the intake pipe, bent the pipe around (the tip is tack welded)til the carb didn&#39;t hit anything, tack the other side of the pipe to the base.&nbsp; i&#39;ll have to take more pics to explain the rest

				this is them homemade dio intake parts. <br />i cut these pieces out of a 1/4&quot; chunk of steel. on the 1st piece i cut the outside shape then put a hobbit intake over it and clamped it, then drilled through both to get the bolt hole lay out right. then cut the hole out of the middle to match the hole in the cases. i used a jig saw with a metal bit.<br />the 2nd piece is the same deal matching the reed valve hole size. clamp and drill.<br />so, that&#39;s the top and bottom. then i bolted the 1st piece to the engine and held the 2nd piece over it facing back, looking to see if i could get the&nbsp; mounting bolts in and out easy. it measured 1 1/8&quot; on the back at that angle, so i cut and tacked that together. then it could be adjusted to find the front length. i cut that one 3/8&quot; and tacked it. the sides are just wedges with the point cut off and the back trimmed.<br />the side material is 10 gauge steel. after i put it together i welded some nuts to the back side of the 2nd piece to make it easier to install and/or take apart.<br />

				then i welded that all good. i put some long bolts in the bottom 2 bolt holes on the case then cut off the heads with the threads sticking up 5/8&quot; in order to make studs for the bottom of the intake to fasten. <br /><br />i cut out another 2nd piece to make a base for the carb to attach to it all. it sets on top of the reed valve when it&#39;s all done.<br />the area that is cover in black marker is where i sliced into the pipe to take the circle shape and start transitioning it to the rectangle shape. so looking at it, that is the shape of the pieces that i had to make fit. when you&#39;re looking at the outside (as in the pic) the cut on the tube is in a &quot;V&quot; shape. that&#39;s how to knock the sides of the circular tube out and get it to start spreading the flow out to the rectangle shape. it looks a little crooked and uneven because i had to twist it and make it work in this situation to clear the frame and the peddle sprocket. it helped to put the carb on when adjusting everything because it has to fit when it&#39;s all put together.

				it&#39;s all there! boner came by and helped adjust the hog pipe to fit and seal a little better. all the wiring is working good and the carb tuning is not so good. but, the engine started and didn&#39;t idle worth a shit and sounded like a lion mauling a bag of potatoe chips when it did run. that was with the jet and needle and idle jet that was in it when i got it.

				22mm keihin Ssam<br />wow, it does look like the 70&#39;s!. only this is the rare 1980 that came standard with the headlight fairing and engine cover. which was an option in &#39;79 but discontinued in &#39;81.<br /><br />ricky brought over about 10 needles. i tried every one until my fingers were about to bleed. then i was like.... the needle that was in the carb when i got it worked??.. so i put it back in there how buster had it set up. ffffffff.. i rode it all over the nayborhood. i even got a &quot;hey, you wanna sell that&quot; from an apple bum!

				yeah, i have good plans for that mercedes exhaust, bring it by and we&#39;ll trade. ;)<br /><br />i show u this.<br />&nbsp;have you ever had one of them crush gaskets that you can&#39;t get to line up? i put a little plumbing flux on the end of the steel header. then i fired up the mapp gas torch and got some solder to stick to it. i melted a few dabs on the copper gasket with the slobbering iron. line it up, solder it on, file it down a fuzz. install.<br />&nbsp;where is the crush gasket? right where i put it.
