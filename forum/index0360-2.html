				more modern looking, mainly. easier to use, easier to disassemble, cheaper to make. didnt snap apart like the switches on the metal ones. everything about the plastic switches was an advantage to puch i&#39;m sure.

				the thing about the metal switches is mounting them is more of a task than on the plastic ones, the handlebar mount on the plastic ones are one piece that screws into the body, on the metal one you have like 3 or 4 pieces that have to all be in the right position for it to start mounting. plus half the ones you find have the switches broken off. i&#39;ve run into a decent amount of broken plastic ones too, but since theyre flat its a lot less common.<br /><br />you mean &quot;Maxi S&quot;? thats just an early distinction for the models that had full suspension.

				dunno, but once a plastic switch is busted,, that&#39;s it,, seems to me, the metal top ones are easier to work with,, and prettier,, so many of the boys around here hate switches all together,, just run it hard wire,, but I&#39;m old school,,&nbsp; &nbsp;the S model,, I thought ,, was the cheaper model.., and the N&nbsp; cheaper yet,,

				yeah, i have a pile of switches, did anyway, sent some out to somebody who was looking for some. first order of business when i get most bikes is to get rid of the switches and simplify the wiring as much as i can. makes them look WAAAAY cleaner. plus none of the switches are necessary anyway. i never turn my lights off, the horn is useless, and i kill my bike with the clutch lever. however i&#39;m all for clean original bikes too, just none of mine are nice enough to leave stock.<br /><br />when the maxi came out, there was ONLY the rigid maxi, just called the maxi. around 1971 full suspension models came out, the rigids were then called maxi N and full suspension models were called Maxi S

				60 miles outside of des moines it got SUPER slick and i ended up in a ditch, i was only going like 40 on the interstate at that point. super gradual slide into the ditch, so slow, sucked.<br /><br />im in osceola at a hotel right now just waiting for the tow ban to be lifted tomorrow so i can get out of here. sucks because my dad is at the hospital right now, i was trying to get home asap...

				yeah. they dont let any tow trucks pull anybody out of the ditches on the interstate until the weather lets up. makes sense. within 2 miles of me going in the ditch, there were 4 others within a couple minutes, it had JUST gotten slick too. i just stopped at the gas station to get some food and i overheard people talking, sounds like its a disaster out there, 10 car pileups and stuff. i guess im glad i went in right when it got slick instead of later when it got really bad.

				between america and austria there were a lot of weird variations after that point, all the bikes were based on maxi S or N models though, with various changes between models...seats, wheels, engine, trunks, racks, forks, turn signals, so on. there were probably something like 40+ variations on the maxi.

				so metal topped switches were the cheap models,, huh? what about the quill stem/triple tree stuff, that confuses me,, I&#39;ve seen the one piece handle bars on newports,, and I had thought those to be top of the line,,,

				yo mike YEAH come up, i&#39;ll toss something together, worst comes to worse ill just ride a passport or some shit, bring that maxi, lets throw a 13 on the front and kill ourselves, i got parts for you dudes too if you want stuffff<br /><br />mark: metal switches werent bottom of the line, aroun 1978 puch just switched to plastic ones. same with the quill stem, 1977/78 was when all the bikes started switching over to the clamp mounting style. mid-77 i think was when they officially switched over. nothing to do with top/bottom of the line, just advances over the years.
