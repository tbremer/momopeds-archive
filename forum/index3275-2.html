			Bought the wrong wheel off of treatland. I&#039;m looking to trade for a rear wheel that will fit my &#039;78 Puch Maxi. It was $75, came with axle, break, tire and the tube seems to hold air. Not looking to make money, just need to get this running again.

			Why won&#039;t it work on your Maxi?

			Only one side has a sprocket, and the brake is on the opposing side

			Check with Benji, he would probably let you return it but you would be out the cost of shipping.

			Right on, fingers crossed. I misplaced my axle, brake and barrings due to moving. The brakes seem so proprietary, i decided to look for a whole wheel instead of going after the individual parts. Bummed, i could have been riding today. I appreciate the advice.
