				This seller is at it again but under a different name.<br />His new Ebay name is : chicagolandcollectibles<br /><br />He is still a jerk.&nbsp; The photos he shows ARE NOT the items you will receive (He has stock photos he has taken that never change). The item you will receive WILL BE rusty, possibly bent, and if it has any parts to it, they will most likely be missing.<br />From what I understand, he used to be involved with a Moped rental years and years ago.<br />The parts are off of these rentals. <br /><br />From my experience it is useless to complain because he will lie until the bitter end about what he sent.<br />Worse is he will attempt to give you bad ebay feedback.<br /><br />Total jerk..<br /><br /><br />MoPeD...<br /><br /><br />
