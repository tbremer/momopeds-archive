			So we went out to this golf course that closed down, bypassed the gate that stops cars. And blasted our asses all over this overgrown golf course... well till my tailpipe about fell off. But yeah, this place was awesome, has fishing ponds/lakes all over. No one there but 1 house with a pontoon boat on the lake in a back corner of the course. Even a VFW hall to park at outside the entrance. I am gonna load up some FA 50s this sunday and go fishing/swimming and mopeding at my new exotic resort. Anyone like to come join me? This place has like&nbsp; 4 or 5 miles of golf cart track still in decent shape. Cleered most the branches of the track already.
