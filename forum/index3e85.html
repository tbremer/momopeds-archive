				I bought a 77 puch maxi last night. I haven&#39;t had the chance to look it over yet but it is currently missing its pedals and crank. It does have one peddle and spindle, no chain. I was thinking about ordering some parts from the moped junkyard.com, Or do you guys think I can find these pedal parts around town? <br /><br />I wish my sundays were more open so I could bring it to the Fort. My wife works at 2 pm sundays and I have to watch our one year old girl. When she is a little older maybe I can bring her too. My wife will kill me when she finds out I bought this. I have to hide it as long as I can and when she finds it I think I am going to tell her I borrowed it, so I may need an alibi from someone.<br /><br />I plan on making it to the park tonight on my no-ped, as long as the head light will stay on. I have had electric problems with it lately. I lost horn,brake light, starter. The headlight is coming and going, but the it stayed on yesterday when I rode it to work so maybe its OK. I am going to bring a flashlight and duct- tape for backup.<br /><br />Matt

				Uhm Id bet dollars to donuts, thoes cranks are readily available, in fact, we might have some folks who just loves a Puch ( Mike, Mark..Im looking in your direction ) thatyou might be able to barter for.<br /><br />Yeah check your electric connections! Something is loose, or frayed...one little strand could short out everything.

				Thanks, I went ahead and got a new chain and some new pedals and I will try and scrounge and barter for the rest when I have a better idea what all is missing. I hope it will run with out too much trouble.<br />

				It has to be that one on cl. That one was missing all that. I was trying to buy that one. The dude told me he would sell it to me for 280 cash. How much did you pay for it. If you don&#39;t mind me asking. Ryan

				I got the Maxi running, ran bad and then got worse. I took off the carb to clean it up and noticed some crap in the cylinder head, or area where the carb bolts to motor. It looked like fiberglass insulation or stuffing of some kind. Has anyone seen this before? I pulled out as much as I could see. I was going to put the carb back on and see if it runs any better or should I tear the engine apart to see what is going on in there?<br />Matt

				WOW?<br /><br />No never heard of that...perhaps a gasket fell in the engine and it made it into insulation?<br /><br />But Ive never owned a Puch so I dont know...<br /><br />

				I&#39;ve never seen that before. &nbsp;But I can tell you with 100% certainty that it&#39;s not supposed to be there.<br /><br />What&#39;d you have to do to get it to run?

				I put a new spark plug in and got it started pretty easy, but no power. I guess I should take it apart and check its condition, put some new gaskets in and put it back together?<br /><br />That was cold, I got Coled. <br />

				Yeah,kinda. I took the jet out and cleaned it with some rubbing alcohol. That was late last night so I did not get a chance to check the rest of the carb out, or put it back together. I will work on it some more wed nite and hopefully I can get it out in the park thursday, or hopefully at least get it going before Moktoberfest! If I cant get it running by then can I ride my scooter in the rally or maybee get a loaner ped for the saturday ride?

				If you pull the head and cylinder, you can inspect the rings and rod. <br />&nbsp;i pulled an intake from a puch motor recently. it had some fiberish looking stuff down in the there.&nbsp; I had guessed carbon buildup, combined with dripping and then evaporating bad gas, condensation,&nbsp; corroding aluminum, rusting metals, nesting insects, over a 30 year period, had formed it. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ring stuck in&nbsp; groove, make&nbsp; puch go slow like solex :D

				If you do pull the head and cylinder, know that the rings on the piston have a gap that has to fit around a pin in each groove when you put it back together.&nbsp; If you look, you&#39;ll know what I&#39;m talking about.&nbsp; If they don&#39;t line up, you&#39;ll break your ring(s) when you try to put it back together.&nbsp; It&#39;s annoying.

				Ok, I got the carb cleaned, pulled the head, looked ok, and put it back together last night. To my supprise it started, but still no power. So I figure its got to be the timing. I am clueless with this kind of thing. Can someone help me get the timing set? I can bring it over to the Fort sunday at noon if someone knows how to help this sick Puch.

				I messed with the timing on my puch last night and I think I got it running better. Its kinda bogged down from a dead stop but once it was going it had a lot more power than before. I let phill take it for a test ride and he thought it may be four-stroking. It still has a gas leak in the float bowl, I don&#39;t know if that would cause an air leak or something that would affect performance. Once I get the proper gasket for the carb I am going to replace gaskets on intake and exhaust and hope it runs good. I took it out for a nice stroll through the park lastnight, its a much better ride than my scooter. If my float bowl gasket gets here before Saturday I may try to ride it in the rally!
