				While waiting for a custom sprocket for the Schwinnmower, I got myself a dead 2-stroke Vino...<br /><br />(http://i.imgur.com/p7gyX.jpg)<br /><br />(http://i.imgur.com/Ma1xE.jpg)<br /><br />...and brought it back to life.<br /><br />(http://i.imgur.com/WKbZJ.jpg)<br /><br />(http://i.imgur.com/X7vbO.jpg)<br /><br />But then I hit a bump and nailed my new exhaust on a rock. Casualties: bent pipe, tweaked flange and a broken exhaust bolt.<br /><br />(http://i.imgur.com/dPyt6.jpg)<br /><br />After bending the flange back to a mostly-flat shape, it still doesn&#39;t align with the head.<br /><br />(http://i.imgur.com/OCRaG.jpg)<br /><br />Can anyone help me get the rest of the broken bolt out and/or re-weld my exhaust so it&#39;ll actually reach the engine?

				All the welders are in StL at the rally this weekend... I&#39;m tied up all weekend too. But I&#39;ll lend a hand if need be.<br /><br />Does the broken bolt stick out at all? Is there anything to get a hold on? If not you&#39;ll have to pull the cylinder so we can drill it. Fun. I might even take it to a machine shop if it&#39;s real bad...<br />As far as making it fit again... I&#39;d try taking it off and bending it staight until it fits, hack and weld as a last resort.<br /><br />Or Fuck it. Get a great big kit and a new pipe and we&#39;ll make that silly bike go 60. ;)<br /><br />

				Justin! I happen to be an extraction pro, you could probably bend the pipe back to fit&#39;n. That&#39;s a Leo Vince right?

				Indeed it is a LeoVince pipe. And unfortunately the bolt broke off slightly inside the head. Looks like it&#39;d have to be pulled or somehow jacked up at a weird angle to access it with a power drill. I have a carbide bit, but am a little hesitant after breaking a screw extractor last time I tried using one.<br /><br />It&#39;s not a super urgent thing to get fixed. I slapped the old pipe back on it and it makes a near perfect seal with just one bolt. Of course now my top end is poopy because of the lighter weights I installed when I put on the new pipe.

				All ya need to do is dremmel on the broken bit and use a screw driver to remove it. If&#39;n yer lucky you might be able to match up the other end of the broken bolt and carefully losen it by hand. screw driver is my favorite way through.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think I might be getting a Scoot when I move to saint-louie.

				Get a dremmel bit that can reach it. You&#39;ll probably have to take the cylinder off. In any case I&#39;ll be out of town till Sunday gimme a ring if you need a hand 5732343763. Oh this is Rob if you didn&#39;t know.

				Didn&#39;t try the carb cleaner, but I can feel it with my hand.&nbsp; I&#39;ll refrain from riding it until it&#39;s fixed, though. I don&#39;t want to blow up this poor little thing. Also hi, Rob! Figured that was you.

				FakeDad, I had to go to work and didn&#39;t see that until now. Midterms are tomorrow and you&#39;re totally leaving town. Bummer.<br /><br />Phil, I definitely still want it. When I put the stock exhaust back on, I instantly missed the acceleration after 10 MPH or so.<br /><br />iamcrkt, I just used the weights that came with the pipe. I think they&#39;re 4.3 grams. I couldn&#39;t get the new clutch springs on, so I&#39;ll wait until the exhaust is fixed before trying that again.<br /><br />I should be receiving some main jets and spark plugs shortly.

				if you have a 6 roller and are using 4.3g you are going to variate right past the powerband of that pipe... or not, we did shorten the header on mine by about 3&quot; (effectively raising the powerband)

				With the stock weights, it was sluggish until about 20 MPH. And now I&#39;m bummed because it&#39;s super nice outside but I have to study for a midterm instead of fixing the Vino. Also a custom sprocket arrived for the schwinnmower so now I have 2 vehicles I have the urge to work on.

				I lied. I put the clutch springs in before fixing the exhaust problems. Maybe tomorrow is the day when I kick over the scooter and just drill on it while it lays on its side.<br /><br />Also: (http://i255.photobucket.com/albums/hh123/ProvostZakharov/Rotten%20Tomatoes%20Photoshop%20Tournament%202008/spidergollum.jpg)
