				I finally got my magnum running yesterday.&nbsp; I still needs some stuff done to it, and to get broken in, but it is pretty sickly fast.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t have any low end...until the clutch engages, then you gotta hold on.<br /><br />I&#39;m getting a GPS in the mail anytime now.&nbsp; Once I get it on there and know how fast I&#39;m actually going, I&#39;ll let yous know.<br /><br />Oh, the setup is nothing crazy.&nbsp; Actually, it&#39;s a &quot;mild&quot; kit setup:<br />65cc metrakit<br />15mm bing<br />matching 15mm intake<br />Techno boss pipe<br />dremeled out the transfers in the case to match the kit<br />stock everything else, and I&#39;m running it real rich for break in

				Cool,<br /><br />As you could see I was not there, my buddy with the 3 wheeled custom&nbsp; Harley came by and we were all set to come over and then, hes tranny wouldnt engage, so after 8 hours of trying to figure it out an comming close and then nothing at all happening...it sits in my garage. I wanted to come to the meeting, believe me, I kept telling hime he needs to buy a moped, we couldve rebuilt 10 of them in the time we took to try to get the clutch to work on his Hardley!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Im still waiting on my Farco M1 engine, then I will start kitting....fun...<br /><br />ANyway, hope to see you guys on THURS, cause its bon voage ciao for me for a few weeks....<br /><br /><br />Ciclomotore&#39;s here I come!

				We may be leaving Thursday evening, or at least some of us will.&nbsp; Depending on who gets off of work when and such, we ralliers might be riding with you Thursday, or not.&nbsp; But there are a lot of people who aren&#39;t going to KC.<br /><br />I&#39;ll be riding/tuning tonight, tomorrow, and Wednesday for sure.&nbsp; I need to get some more miles on this kit before rally riding.

				Will do.&nbsp; I&#39;ll see who shows up, and what they&#39;re doing.&nbsp; It might just be me taking short trips around Soulard trying to tune and break in my kit.&nbsp; Or a bunch of people might show up...<br /><br />I told people to show up at Mark&#39;s at 6 each day.

				GPS verified at 46.9mph today on Gravois.&nbsp; I wasn&#39;t going all out, since the kit isn&#39;t broken in yet.&nbsp; And that was hit on a slight incline.&nbsp; She should be a screamer.

				47.4mph last night. Gravois after midnight as mostly blinky yellow lights.&nbsp; Perfect for top speed tests.<br /><br />But going over the bridge into downtown on Tucker today, my front brake seized up...going like 2mph in the left lane with everyone else going 45+ is 0% fun, and 100% scary.
