				anybody got a leakdown tester thatll fit&nbsp; honda nu?&nbsp; got a airleak somewhere around where intake meets case but thats where the case halfs meet&nbsp; so I don&#39;t know which it is,&nbsp; intake or case?&nbsp; ran fine up until it didn&#39;t&nbsp; &nbsp;been takin the intake off a lot here lately&nbsp; so maybe it&#39;s that so I need to make a gasket it for it what s&nbsp; a good material for that purpose

				I use that grey gasket paper from the auto parts store. I think there is a blue one, cork, and the grey one will work for intakes and base gaskets. I have some at my house.<br /><br />I dont even know what a leakdown tester is, I use carb cleaner.

				yeah I just picked up some rubber/fiber 1/32 stuff I&#39;m guessing that should work eh?&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>leakdown test</em>= pump in 6psi air through Schrader valve&nbsp; pressurizes your motor, plug the intake and exhaust depending on how your attaching it, I like the through the plug for mine anyway but whateverworks. If theres a drop in pressure = leak somewhere.&nbsp; I read that spraying windex in those suspect areas will make bubbles so you know where your leak is coming from.&nbsp; now if I can just find one, if I cant&nbsp; I&#39;ll have to make one and rent it out for beer hehe

				spraying carb cleaner in the suspected area will cause the bike to die down, letting you know that there is indeed (or isn&#39;t hopefully!) an air leak.

				yeah done that but its in an area where its too hard to tell if its the case seal or the intake seat they&#39;re all right there together.&nbsp; I will make a intake gasket first and if that dont work bingo splittin time.&nbsp; ya think a malling ax will split it?&nbsp; i will practice my aim

				made intake to case gasket put it on and took it for a ride last night,&nbsp; &nbsp;it was still actin the same got late called it a night.&nbsp; today I was bound and determined to find this leak&nbsp; sprayin shit everywhere eyes, nose, throat and motor etc....&nbsp; found that the carb bowl had a bad seal(funny never had a leaking issue) carb to intake seal wasnt good either, so I pulled the carb off my utter bike stuck it on this one and it&#39;s all good now,&nbsp; Trying to work around the tuning and getting the right plug most of the plugs I get are bp series (bp6hs) or bpr6hs now if I go to a colder plug like a 7 or 8 what would the numbers be? Oreillys didnt seem to know and didnt have anything.<br /><br />&nbsp; I put a used 6 in and it read like a brownish (rich) but ran ok except at wot (bog) put a 5 in and the plug was much cleaner but the tip was white and there was not much if any color that scared me to lean? ran ok except a wot&nbsp; So I&#39;m thinking of going colder but I need to get a plug to try it out

				this is a stupid question I know but on the resistor plug&nbsp; what is that all about?&nbsp; isn&#39;t that for frequency canceling? or feedback to like sensors or something, so why on a moped does it communicate with the cdi?&nbsp; i got one thats all they had
