				Because of the storms they are pridicting tomorrow, we ARE moving the BBQ fundraiser for Matt to Saturday May 15th!&nbsp; <br /><br />(If somone who has Matts number could please call him and make sure he and his sister know this has been moved to the 15th that would be a huge help!)<br /><br />The plan is to set everything up by 9:30am<br />Begin BBQing at 10:AM&nbsp; Selling food from 11:00-3PM&nbsp; &nbsp;(from past experience most food sells between 12:45 and 2:00)&nbsp; <br />Clean up at 3pm.<br /><br />If any of the IRE members or other moped groups could come to this event and bring your peds it would help draw attention to this to raise more money for Matt!&nbsp; (O&#39;Fallon area is a fun place to ride mopeds!)&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, sorry that it was so hard nailing down an alternate date!&nbsp; Special thank you to the IRE members for allowing us to visit you and ride in your ralleys you all are great!&nbsp; <br />See you all at the Ralley next weekend and hopefully the BBQ on the 15th!&nbsp; : )
