				I have a Walther p22.&nbsp; Sweet gun, around $300 or less.&nbsp; .22lr caliber.&nbsp; Hella reliable, simple to use, simple to clean.&nbsp; Not the most &quot;stopping power&quot; though.<br /><br />I also have a Mateba 6 Unica.&nbsp; Out of production, strange combination of a revolver and a semi-auto.&nbsp; .357 magnum.&nbsp; Kicks ass and I love it.&nbsp; Most people have never seen or heard of one.&nbsp; They&#39;re nearly impossible to find and stupidly expensive.<br /><br />Are you looking to carry it or keep it around the house?<br /><br />I&#39;ve looked at, and considered getting these:<br />Walther p99<br />Walther PPK<br />Ruger sp101<br />Ruger LCP

				Depends on how much you wanna spend too. &nbsp;Also consider the caliber and how much that cost to shoot. &nbsp;You don&#39;t want to get something that you can&#39;t afford to shoot a lot. &nbsp;I am talking a hundred rounds once a week, to start at least. &nbsp;Then you can go down to maybe 50 rounds a month/every two weeks or something. &nbsp;If you have never fired a handgun before, it is very difficult and requires lots and lots of practice if you want to rely on it for anything.<br /><br />Caliber isn&#39;t all that important though, don&#39;t get stuck on it. Some people are super into one caliber and they are propaganda nuts about it. Shot placement is where it is at.<br /><br />9mm is cheap and you can get just about any pistol in it.<br />.45 is a tried and true low pressure cartridge with a big heavy bullet.<br />.357 sig or 10mm are your badass rounds in my opinion.<br /><br />I had a 1911 clone. Its a .45 and they are pretty iconic guns. Its a pretty legendary pistol.<br /><br />(//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/M1911_Pistol_US.jpg/300px-M1911_Pistol_US.jpg)<br /><br />Sigs are some of the best guns you can get though.<br /><br />Go to a range and take a class. You should be able to try out a few guns. You can rent guns too.

				Guns are cool, buy whatever has the cheapest ammo, you&#39;ll wanna shoot it and .45&#39;s are expensive as shit. Hell even my .38&#39;s arent cheap. Stick to 9mm or 40 cal.<br /><br />Lots of people like Glocks.. I&#39;m not a fan. I like Smith and Wesson or Sig Sauer guns, they are both good companies to buy a gun from. <br /><br />I just dont like the registry laws when you purchase a new one.

				What registry laws are you talking about?&nbsp; Missouri is a no documentation state, and the NRA goes to great lengths both to ensure that all record are destroyed like they&#39;re supposed to be, and that the laws don&#39;t change.<br /><br />And yeah, fuck a glock.&nbsp; Shitty plastic guns that you have to pull the trigger to clean.&nbsp; Stupid design.&nbsp; And they don&#39;t shoot nicely.&nbsp; The ones I&#39;ve shot have just always been uncomfortable.

				I dont like my name to be associated with any guns. When you buy new, dont you have to give them your info.. maybe its just for a background check. Either way I would prefer to not give out the info when it comes to something like that. I just dont like others to know what I have, especially the gov.

				I shoot Glocks well... but I would never buy one. Maybe a 10mm just to be a piece of junk gun to be abused. Glocks are kind of expensive for what you get. They are also made of Tupperware :P<br /><br />

				I like 22 pistols, ammo is cheap so you can practice shooting and still afford more mopeds.&nbsp; Even better don&#39;t buy a gun and use the money to buy more mopeds.&nbsp; I have a 50cal black powder rifle and have more fun shooting it than most other things.
