				Ryan and I decided to use &quot;The Works&quot; to clean the tank on his Maxi, this is what resulted.<br /><br />[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3shT8AarQYo[/youtube]<br /><br />What you see bubling there is what is left of the petcock valve<br />(http://www.pb-commandos.com/img/works.JPG)<br /><br />I&#39;m no chemist but, I guess it reacts to whatever magnesium was mixed into the slurry of metals used to cast the petcock. Be fore warned, That&#39;s some strong shit! <br /><br /><br /><br />Be careful when you use this shit.

				I used this too, and you aren&#39;t kidding. I took off the petcock and used some clear hose from the hardware store with a cork in the end, so I didn&#39;t have to worry about the petcock. I tried to keep it off the gas cap, but some of it got on the plastic cup and ate almost all the way through it in places. I also got some on the garage floor, and it ate away the concrete faster than the concrete etcher I usually use to do tanks. I avoid muriatic acid because of how strong people say it is, but this stuff has got to be up there in terms of toxicity and danger.

				I just had an epiphany. Maybe some of you already knew this, but you didn&#39;t bother to mention it to those of us who are not fluent in chemical, so...<br /><br />I was gonna go add &quot;The Works&quot; to the &quot;Removing Rust from a Gas Tank&quot; wiki page. The first thing on that page says &quot;Muriatic (Hydrochloric) Acid.&quot; Wikipedia confirms that these are the same thing. &quot;The Works&quot; is essentially hydrochloric acid -- so muriatic acid. So I&#39;ve been pansying out on using muriatic acid because of what everyone says about it, but turns out, I was using it anyway. I probably would have been more careful using it if I&#39;d known that to begin with. <br /><br />Anyway, what do you all think about adding this to the wiki page anyway? I could either put it in the muriatic acid section as a side note, like, &quot;The Works bathroom cleaner is a product containing this acid,&quot; or as a new section (mentioning the first section), or not at all?

				not 10 minutes ago the guy at the vespa shop up the street said to me,,,,Yeah,,that&#39;s the same thing as Muriatic acid,,,and continued to explain the problems with making the bomb....and how acid goes everywhere, and he&#39;d drop the foil in and put the cap on, but let someone else shake it...
