				This spiring I really want to truck the maxi down to KC and do some riding. Should I just plan on trucking it downtown, or has anyone thought of a creative route from up north? <br /><br />I&#39;m located in KC right outside Liberty....what do you think take 291? Backroads and neighborhoods until 169? Each option is like 55mph - shit seems fast for my slow going, small town, riding situation. <br /><br />Also, is KC going to pull me? Mopeds aren&#39;t legal on the highways right? I&#39;m hoping my setup will hit 45 so I know I won&#39;t be able to keep up with traffic, but I was pretty sure not legal anyway so...yeah guess I&#39;ll have to truck it downtown? <br /><br />Did I just answer my own question?

				I live 45 miles from the K.C. limits to the south. As a practical matter I rarely ride to K.C. due to the time factor. I do however ride on the rural highways, mostly on the side of the road to get from town to town. It is legal as long as you keep off the Interstate, as a matter of courtesy and safety I try to stay off of roads without wide paved sides. When I go to K.C. for rides I load my bike into whatever vehicle I have and go. Saves time and worry.

				^^ sounds good man I would be down for sure! I&#39;m starting to think the bridge would be a little risky, but there&#39;s plenty of places to ride up north.

				We&#39;ve crossed the Burlington St./ 71 Bridge into NKC on some of our rides, not to hairy, though best to remain seated in a standard manner with working lights at the speed limit in NKC to avoid exciting the local constables.

				Why not just come down US69 past the claycomo plant up to Vivian rd. Take Vivian rd to Cheateau trfky or North Oak turn south. Either the Cheateau or Heart of America bridge will get you across the river.

				Can you get to Blue Springs easily? Bannister Road is THE most awesome ride you&#39;ll ever do. Just south of Blue Springs, runs straight to the city. Really safe, you won&#39;t get shot or run over.

				If I can get it down there I can get it to Blue Springs no problem. I would be down for the Bannister ride for sure!

				I agree with Gazoo, I would run through NKC on Oak Trafficway. The speed limit is 35-45 I believe and if memory serves correct... a median or small bike lane over the bridge, I used to do it on a Honda Spree when I lived in the River Market. It would get a little hairy at going over the bridge, but I would heavily consider it over 71/169. The other low speed alternate crossings would be Chateau by Harrahs or in Riverside by the Argosy.
