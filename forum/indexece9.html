				Tomos Targa: <br /><br />I believe it is a 2005, traded for it a while back. Runs great, has a biturbo pipe, everything else is stock. No title but I believe I still have the bill of sale from when I picked it up. Mainly used around campgrounds for the past year. Not in excellent condition, I would rate it fair. Has spray painted faring, bent pedal arms, and a dent in the tank. Has locking gas cap which I&#039;ve got the key for somewhere. Comes with an extra carb and some turn signals. Looking to get $450. <br /><br />Freespirit: <br /><br />Frame and tank are in good condition. Seat has a small rip, needs new petcock and tires. Was seized when I got over a year ago, broke it free and cleaned it up a bit to see if could get it running. Crank is tight but could definitely use a new top end. Had it running last year, very rough though. Has side covers. Looking to get $200. <br /><br />Honda Express: <br /><br />Come take this off my hands for free if you buy the targa or freespirit. Have a orange frame, with a motor that did run until the kick spring broke. My friend tried the kickstart conversion and failed so I have a hand full of parts in a tub that go with it. It ended up getting cannibalized to restore my other express. <br /><br />Located in Effingham, IL. Can travel to meet within reason. <br /><br />Sorry for the bad pictures. The Express and Freespirit were a bit buried in my shed. <br /><br />Picture Gallery (//1drv.ms/1FZKEBp)<br /><br />The Blue Express is not for sale.
