				What happened to the seat cushion? Does he take it with him when he gets off the bike? Is that a form of theft protection? Or is it like a community bring your own seat bike? Maybe there is a slot for quarters and once you fill the gas tank with them, the seat inflates and you ride it. You know those little rides that used to be outside grocery stores, k marts, and wall marts. How come there is never a moped one for kids/adults to ride? Do those even exist anymore? I miss being a kid. I would play a moped video game if they had one. You could deliver news papers(like paper boy on Nintendo), metal detect for riches, sell drugs, or whatever to make money. Then use said money to upgrade/mod your moped with sweet stuff like a removable/inflatable coin feed seat.

				Babetta sold.<br /><br />Trike available.&nbsp; <br />1. $400 no motor-I will include the swing arm and rear mag that matches the front (16&quot; 5 stars from testi).&nbsp; Wheels should be worth some money if you decided to put a spoked wheel on the front of the trike and sell them as a set.<br />2. $450 with pedal start v1 included-coming off my tri-ped and runs great. You install the motor and finish.&nbsp; Time is short this summer and a string of injuries has me backed up with projects.<br />3. I could be convinced to sell it with the v1lks w/ ducatti electronic ignition but consider that this would cost considerably more than a v1.<br />
