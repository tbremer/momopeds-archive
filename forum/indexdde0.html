			I&#039;m new to the forum but i feel i may know some of you already<br /><br />I&#039;ve got 2 Montgomery Ward open road mopeds that I&#039;m trying to merge and hope to ride with you sometime.<br /><br />BTW i saw a pack of &#039;peds in the loop on 5/24 head south on Skinner. was that you?<br /><br />

			Yeah, that was us. That was our rally that we hosted at Shady Jack&#039;s that weekend.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know much about those bikes but I think Mark has/had one. Aren&#039;t they the weird liquid cooled head?<br />From the look of the picture you may be able to get both together, they look pretty complete, but it may be better to combine them and have some spare parts.<br /><br />What part of town are you in?
