				My bike is here in Frontenac occupying one of the &quot;student lifts&quot; at the Harley School. Due to freshman apathy in the school no one else is using the lifts, heh. I&#39;m hunting down my gremlins and terminating them. Today is carburetor day and I&#39;m pretty sure its infested. I will be attending the fix-it/ride days when/if school clears up on tuesdays in a couple of weeks and weekends when I&#39;m not in concert somewhere. Fame is so demanding.

				Are we fixing this Sunday? I want to fix my Tomos before school is over, and I&#39;m having nut issues. Why is it that out of all the parts on a moped, the nuts, bolts, and screws are the parts that suck up 80% of fixing time?

				Yes I do Fix it ON MY OWN. I am sure it simialar to you taking apart your magnum in your basement. We all live at different houses and packing up a moped in a mustang to come over to your place with my crap ton of tools and work outside doesnt suit me well. I am sure you dont wanna fix your magnum at my place either. I dont have nearly as many tools. Fix it days are only feesable when you have a large storage shed, simialar to Marks place to store broke ass peds and come fix them while riding another bike there. I am completely content with bringing small projects, off the bike stuff over and hanging out. I think all of this is getting out of hand. There has been way too much drama lately. We cant expect bangers to show up right, maybe not even Linda b/c of distance issues, everyone has issue. <br />The days I want to work on stuff, its either raining or cold out, and I can sit in my basement or garage and do work. If you want to come over and watch or help I dont mind in the least, I&#39;d do the same for you if you want me to. I just want to ride when its nice out and if it doesnt fit everyones schedules or the peds arent running, well I&#39;ll ride on my own. <br />I&#39;d rather we looked past all of our individual issues and realized we all love to ride, and fix stuff. We just dont want to have those 2 things appose eachother. We should try and focus on planning ride days where if you have a running moped, and free time..when there is no rain or crap weather, then we ride. I think we are making all of this too complicated and we should focus on making our bikes better by the next time the weather is nice. <br />Some people dont work hard on their peds and so they dont ride, its that simple. I think certain stuff we should help eachother with, but we cant have people coming over expecting to have a kitted well tuned clutch modified perfect brake bike ready before the sun sets. I&#39;m sure we are willing to do some work, but not in one day. I feel like a lot of people have abused you, Matt, for being knowledgeable and willing to spend hours helping. If your shit is broke and you cant fix it, then ask for some help, SOME being the key word. None of us should be required to help the other person out with a complete build. We can guide the newbz and give them pointers, maybe show them how to do timing, or how to dremel. However we shouldnt have to build a bike for someone who shows only enthusiasum with it being finished. We should just be there when one person breaks down, so we can tow them back and continue riding. From my stand point we havent spent a lot of time riding, we&#39;ve been worried about other stuff and how some people cant make it on a given day b/c they are broke, working, they have kids, they are going on a trip... that stuff is life. We ride to ride and try and be helpful to eachother. I hope my post doesnt come off as derogitory to anyone. I want us all to be a part of riding, even if we cant all have awsomely fast nice peds, or even working peds. Baby steps lead to builders, lead to better riders, lead to awsome moped friends. Maybe others can chime in with what they think or what needs to be done so we can all spend more time in a group riding, fixing is just the shit side of riding too hard or too jank. I like to fix, but not with 10 people who want to ride waiting on me to finish it. That stuff jinxes it from the get go. <br /><br />I also think fix it days would be better named everyone do this day. Powdercoat day at a dudes house with a powdercoater, or sandblast at the sandblast place, engine rebuild and watch day for the newbz. I think that way we would benifit from the first person(I&#39;m volunteering for that) to fuck it up and we see how, hopefully not causing everyone to laugh, especially on sandblast tank day...no holes please.<br /><br />For those of us who live close to eachother, we dont need to make plans we need to make phone calls &quot;wanna ride its nice as hell&quot; &quot;nah dude my shit is broke&quot; &quot;well dude I got a ped if you wanna ride with me, its slow as shit, but yeah its nice out, dont spend today in the garage or basement, lets ride&quot;...Or &quot;hey man its shitty out, you wanna work on that karado case&quot;..&quot;how bout that ZA that no one seem to know how to put together, lets try and figure that shit out&quot;...&quot;ohh my e50 has some stripped bolts, its shitty out wanna work on it&quot;...or the simple &quot;hey man do you got plans for the next...(insert time alotment here)<br /><br />Peace to all my dudes, dudettes and homies,<br />Kevin<br /><br />Sorry for the long post, I had to ventalate.

				Kevin&#39;s been having rides and fixits? Don&#39;t feel bad; he didn&#39;t invite me either. <br /><br />If Kevin is fixing his mopeds by himself, I guess that makes four of us who have been working on our mopeds alone this week. <br /><br />So, it appears that there is a problem with the fix it day concept (among other things). If we ride on Sundays, people show up with broken mopeds, and we spend too much time fixing the broken mopeds and not enough time riding. If we plan fix-it days, people don&#39;t show up or can&#39;t come. I think Kevin has a point about people not wanting to pack things up to come -- either him or anyone else. As far as I know, I&#39;m the only one who is really set up for mobile repairs. Yes, I&#39;m sure we could all use the tools at whoever&#39;s house we&#39;re at, but that would be annoying if we all needed the same tools at the same time, and that doesn&#39;t solve the inconvenience of having to transport project mopeds back and forth. Kevin, I&#39;d be more than happy to pick up you and your moped and transport it to Chuck and Matt&#39;s house for a fix-it day, but I obviously can&#39;t do that if I can&#39;t come to fix-it. (That offer applies to anyone and everyone in KC or between KC and Lawrence). <br /><br />Kevin, I think that your &quot;name the fix-it&quot; days sound good in theory, but it wouldn&#39;t work with the reality of mopeds. Not only will everyone always have 10 different things to fix, even if you got a few people who all had similarly-themed repairs, there&#39;s no saying that something else with a higher fixing priority wouldn&#39;t break before the designated fix-it day. I&#39;m not saying it wouldn&#39;t work occasionally and for big projects, but I wouldn&#39;t want to rely on that plan to fix the day-to-day stuff that goes wrong with mopeds. <br /><br />Since at least four of us have proven just in this discussion that we are perfectly capable of working on our mopeds alone (well, at least the rest of you have proven you&#39;re capable -- me I&#39;m not so sure about...), how badly do we need a group fix-it anyway? Is it just to help the newbs? How many newbs do we have? And could/would they even show up at a regular fix-it day anyway? I don&#39;t know that this idea would work any better than Kevin&#39;s, but maybe fix-it days should be &quot;by appointment only.&quot; As in, if someone has something that is broken, and it is beyond their expertise, capabilities, or tool set to fix, then they can put out a &quot;Help me!&quot; message. Then, anyone with the expertise (etc) to help could set up a time to help the person fix whatever is wrong. If anyone besides the help-ee or helper wanted to join in, then they could, but nobody besides the two original people would be EXPECTED to be there. I&#39;m just thinking that this would let us ignore the stress of group fix-its while still letting people who need help get help, and would thus allow us to focus on riding (which is the priority for most of us anyway, yes?) <br /><br />Also, as a general observation about fixing stuff... when you&#39;re a newb, I honestly think you end up being more knowledgeable if you DON&#39;T automatically have people around to help you. I knew NOTHING about mopeds or anything mechanical when I first got a moped. Naturally, it broke. I didn&#39;t have anyone to fix it for me or help me fix it (other than through the power of the interwebz), so I had no choice but to get in there and do it myself.&nbsp; Yes, there is a difference between helping someone do something and doing it for them, but how often does &quot;help me do this&quot; quickly become &quot;do this for me&quot;? Matt, when people know that there&#39;s someone as knowledgeable as you around, it&#39;s soooooo temping to say, &quot;Well, I could do this, but it&#39;s too hard/I don&#39;t know enough/I might screw it up, so I should let Matt help me/do it for me.&quot; And when that happens, people don&#39;t learn as much as they could. I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;ve got this backwards -- maybe you&#39;d rather help people out before they fuck up stuff with a gung-ho DIY attitude (and then REALLY need help fixing it), but from my experience, you learn a lot more when you do things on your own.<br /><br />Bottom line: I sense unhappiness here. I don&#39;t like unhappiness. Mopeds make me happy. Riding mopeds makes me happy. You &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; make me happy. Riding mopeds with you &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; makes me REALLY happy. I want you &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; to be happy. How can I make you all happy? If I can&#39;t make you happy, can you at least lie to me and tell me that there is something I can do to make you happy, and then let me do it, and then lie to me again and tell me you&#39;re happy? Please? Happy? <br /><br />--insert side note--<br />And for the record, I am sorry that I&#39;ve been missing so much stuff lately. Believe me, it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t want to be there. I can scrounge up a little bit of spare to spend on mopeds, but I don&#39;t have so much time that I can drive to and from KC twice a week right now. My plans to &quot;leave early&quot; always fail because I never want to leave, so that&#39;s not a viable compromise given my current time constraints. School is a bitch right now -- I&#39;ve got 2 papers/presentations due within a week, and I still have significant amounts of research and writing to do for both. I would have had 3 papers due, but I managed to get an extension on one of them (only because I was sick and missed two weeks of class earlier this semester). After I get those papers and presentations done, I have to study for 4 finals and write one paper and research/write another paper. As I said, school is a bitch right now.<br />--end side note--<br /><br />

I have had a few here and there for my friends. I have piles of CDI boxes that we could have released with the magneto/stator at the same price but we weren?t that stoked on the performance out of them so I am having them redesigned to better meet our ideas and needs, cause I don;t want to send our some lame shit. &lt;b&gt;this will be V1. V2 will occur after a few months of the people testing them and when we can come up with a clear table that relates rpm/advance and they will be made in small runs and be hella cheap.&lt;/b&gt; so this week we will be emailing out to all those who ordered the $99 CDI pack to find out if they want a one or two speed version cause we have noticed lots of differences between performance depending on our many test boxes ** cuperteens tell your testing tales here**the pack is a free upgrade with regulator, 12v coil, and the current best rpm/advance ratio curve for your bike that we have found so far. its a constant progression forwards that we will all be part of. after all why would I want to trust myself to make such serious and life changing (ya for real) decisions, haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

				The date on that post is like so 5 days ago. The Treats site has the news that the boxes will be available in a week or so for $10-$15 in 1 0r 2 speed flavors. I can&#39;t wait to be done with the flaky spark system. You notice all the test pilots are surprisingly silent in that topic.

				Yeah, but it sounds like in a couple months, they&#39;ll have it down &lt;i&gt;even better&lt;/i&gt; and it&#39;ll be &lt;i&gt;even cheaper.&lt;/i&gt; And plus then it&#39;ll come as a whole kit, although I guess it doesn&#39;t really matter so long as all the pieces/parts are in stock.

				Well, if fix-it day is on, I&#39;m there. No group meeting &#39;till late Sunday night this time. Wohoo! So we can show up after like, 12:30 or 1? I guess I can just call you tomorrow afternoon and see what&#39;s up.

				Well, I&#39;m in hawaii right now. I&#39;d be more than willing to help out new dudes and ladies. I just won&#39;t spend all day working on other peoples stuff, especially if I had planned on riding that day. I won&#39;t be back until tuesday the 12th for a ride in the evening...hopefully. I met 2 new guys, one works at ACE, right up the street from my house. I&#39;m considering selling him my foxi. Hopefully there will be more people riding with us in the very near future. Keep up the hard work, while I&#39;m on vacation ;)

I got one from benji, threw it on my magnum and it went really really really really fast. I should have GPS&#39;d it, but I&#39;d wager 55-58 on 18x40 (za50). I was doing maybe 45 before CDI. I managed to blow a 1st gear clutch in under 5 miles because it ripped so hard. In LA it was the 4th fastest bike behind Shaw, another cuperteen and a creature, but it was probably spinning higher rpms than all them except shaw. My CDI testing companions have had equally good luck. One put it on his ripper pinto which has always done 42 (super low end polini), and it had more torque, and did nearly 46, getting there much faster. For the weekend I decided I wanted to try it on my MagnumX. It was doing 37 with points. I bolted the CDI on and got a bit better mid-range and maybe 2 miles an hour up top. Our only issues have come in hacking stators, testing boxes not designed for the stator and attempting to transplant the system onto other motors. I&#39;m not sure what you mean when you say west coast electronics are laid back when we build consistently the fastest, and most reliable bikes in the states. With this CDI system the playing field will be a bit more level, but more importantly, we can all have consistent, powerful spark so that tuning variable can be partially removed. While setting points is a menial task, perfecting your timing for MAXIMUM power is quite difficult, and cannot typically be done to a spec. <br /><br />Regardless, the CDI is awesome, and an amazing deal for the reliability and power it will get you.

				Sorry Zack, not meaning to step on any toes. I have been following the CDI story quite closely. The &quot;laid back&quot; jibe was a reference to the ancient and hallowed jokes about English &quot;Lucas&quot; electronics where various exagerations attempt to explain their dodgy performance. ie: Why do Brits drink warm beer? Because they have Lucas Refridgerators. or What were Lord Lucas&#39;s final words? &quot;Don&#39;t drive in the dark&quot;. Referenced in this particular case, &quot; Lucas electronics perform the way they do, because Britain has no natural electron supply and must import them from colonial sources.&quot;&nbsp; Thus I was making a quip that &quot;electrons&quot; ( charged electrical particals ) from California might reflect the national perception of the residents of the state of California, ie: &quot;Laid back.&quot; and thus be the cause of the dearth of &quot;Tales of Rippage&quot;. I am quite aware of the difficulties encountered in translating one electronic system into another system.(to be continued)

				When something new comes out the pressure is on and I was not trying to denigrate your gangs electrical engineering abilities but was &quot;summarizing&quot; the news, as it had been told up to that very moment. I further invoke the time honored rule of comedic diplomatic immunity, in that being from the state of California, I am allowed to make jokes referencing the state. Do I expect anyone to &quot;get&quot; my humor? of course not, the references are entirely too obscure and arcane. Now if you will excuse me, its probably about to rain for the thousandth time this month here in Kansas and I must find my flippers.-Bangers

				I got the humor...and Im from the MID COAST!<br /><br />I think Zack should venture out here before he boasts of the &quot;...the fastest bikes in the states...&quot; I know a girl named Sue that has been blasting fools for years... <br /><br />Im not trying to pick a fight, but saying such a blanket statement with little validation or research to back it up, is rather trite, no?<br /><br />See you on the track!

				I should have worded &quot;fastest in the states&quot; differently, but in the moped world, I doubt many people, if any, are faster than Shaw. He was cruising about 70 at the latebirds rally, and has built bikes that can go even faster. At the races this weekend, the scooter hobbit was dusting all the mopeds, some of which were at LA and were the &quot;fastest&quot;. His bike allegedly has done 90, I can&#39;t confirm that, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised based on what I saw yesterday. Once my za50 is re-rebuilt, I&#39;ll set it for blast mode and GPS it. Guaranteed 60+ bike, along with my derbi. Moped tech is pushed, and is changing very quickly out here leading to some amazingly fast bikes. <br /><br />Until you&#39;ve ridden out here, most don&#39;t know how fast the bikes really are. There are a handful of exceptions of fast east/mid coast bikes, but on sheer numbers alone, california dusts all other states. <br /><br />Bangers, I was just trying to show we haven&#39;t had any real CDI issues putting it on a puch. Its been super easy, and has made some really reliable bikes. Cuperteens feature two electrical engineers by trade, but much of our electrical is still suspect.
