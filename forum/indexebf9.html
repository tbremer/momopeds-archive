			So I picked up my first Honda today, it didn&#039;t run, but I fixed the lose wire and now it runs. Runs is a bit of an over statement though, cuz she don&#039;t go no where, and that is not because the back tire was flat. But hopefully with the help of a gimp wizard and the terminator. I can get it fixed up and be in the variator club real soon.

			Update. I need parts. I require a stock PA II or Hobbit Jug, Variator ramp plate, Exhaust pipe, and reed cage with 2 or more pedals. The jug I got is missing some material at exhaust port, the port itself is tiny. The reed cage just has 1 reed. the intake is 10mm and so is the carb. The exhaust pipe looks welded and rewelded a number of times. Dan said he thinks he has a spare Jug, reed cage, and stock exhaust pipe for me. if anyone has a spare variator ramp plate from the stock hobbit/pa2 I may also be interested for the time being. they are sold out on the plates on treats atm. I may also be interested in a stock carb. I have some chineese junk on it atm. I may also be interested in any other parts you got lying around you would like to sell for the honda. Thanks
