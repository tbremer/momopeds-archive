				I am thinking of getting my first tat.&nbsp; I never had anything good enough to want to affix permanently to my body, but now I might.<br /><br />Ne te qu?siveris extra<br /><br />Here&#39;s an online source for the essay it comes from...<br /><br />//www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm<br /><br />A few translations, some metaphorical, varying in trueness to Emerson&#39;s message:<br /><br /><br />&quot;Stretch your arm no farther than your sleeve will reach&quot;<br />&quot;Cut your Coat according to your Cloth&quot;<br />&quot;and do not look further than yourself&quot;<br /><br />&quot;deproduction: literally, it means &quot;don&#39;t seek yourself outside&quot;. The message is, you find yourself by looking inwards, not by turning to teachers and preachers and judgements of others.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;From the poet Persius, who lived in the first century AD: &quot;... nec te quaesiveris extra&quot;. It is the last part of a sentence which is, I think, advice to a writer that if he finds that ignorant people do not understand him, he should take no notice, and simply stick to his own judgement.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Here is the quote from Emerson&#39;s essay I like best:<br /><br />&quot;Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life&#39;s cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, half possession. That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him. No man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it.&quot;<br /><br />I&#39;m thinking, appropiate Latin lettering, on the right shoulder, black, simple.&nbsp; And if I were to get it, I&#39;d like recs. on where you guys got yours.<br /><br />Thx

				I think it&#39;s a cool idea man.&nbsp; I like the phrase a lot.<br /><br />Ryne and I got our I.R.E. tattoos out in St. Charles from a friend of his brother.&nbsp; It&#39;s called Big Bear Tattoo, but it&#39;s a heck of a treck if you&#39;re trying to take your TFR.<br /><br />Tom got his I.R.E. tat at All Star, I think.&nbsp; It was pricey, but they did a damn good job.<br /><br />I&#39;ve heard Iron Age is a great place, but they have a waiting list or something.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know first hand, just what I&#39;ve heard.<br /><br />I think I&#39;ve heard Trader Bob&#39;s is good too, but I can&#39;t remember from who...

				Thanks for the advice.&nbsp; I am mulling it but am almost sure.&nbsp; Ideas on cost?&nbsp; I want it done in a typeface I can&#39;t post here... basically the letters have serifs (those little tips at the ends of T&#39;s, etc.) and are &quot;split&quot; with white space in between a thick line and a thin line.&nbsp; It wouldn&#39;t be hard but to do it right and keep the lettering &quot;square&quot; would take a skilled artist.&nbsp; Naturally it has to be done as close to perfectly as possible, becuase it is probably the only one I&#39;d ever get.&nbsp; I can hear the &quot;yeah rights&quot; now&nbsp; :D<br /><br />And it does connect my to my childhood, teen years and early 20s...

				Dustin at All Star is a fantastic artist, Pepto from Trader Bobs did my IRE tattoo, he was great too.<br /><br />I would reccomend Trader Bobs or All Star if I had my two cents about it.<br /><br />Look through portfolios when you are there, find a place you are comfortable with.<br /><br />Tip your artist and remember that Jesus loves you.

				&quot;Stretch your arm no farther than your sleeve will reach.&quot;<br /><br />That&#39;s what my mom used to say when she wanted my old coat to last just a little longer after I had a growth spurt.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t know she was poetic!
