				Hmm, a trifecta of unofficial gangs. &nbsp;We should invade some unsuspecting small town. &nbsp;I saw this thing where this tiny town in Europe somewhere is taken over yearly by massive amounts of motorcycles. &nbsp;Like, you can&#39;t walk/ride in the streets because motorcycles and people are covering every square milimeter of space. &nbsp;And the locals love it, because it is like the only thing keeping their local economy afloat. &nbsp;We should do that.
