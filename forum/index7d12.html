				1991 Chevy S-10, lopes and pisses me off. I have to feather the crap out of it to get her up to speed. rough idle, and when I&#39;m cruising along the highway and floor it, I LOSE power.<br /><br />Replaced MAP sensor, IAC, so far, little better, but not a lot. Replacing the EGR today, after that, I suppose the TPS? If that doesn&#39;t work then who knows.<br /><br />Once warm, it runs better, but still, if I can&#39;t get it running right before Street Warrior, I&#39;ll have to scam a ride.

				alright here is the details so far:<br /><br />meet and great 31st &amp; McGee (the field) whenever you get here on Friday Night.&nbsp; Then there is a short night ride.&nbsp; Saturday Morning 11:00-Noon coffee &amp; breakfast. then at 12:300-1:00pm fuel up and then ride around the city! Get back to the field for food, beer, and moped related field games. Pass out at some point.&nbsp; There is also a mini ride at night.&nbsp; Sunday wake up ride if you want ...then then go home:).&nbsp; I think there is more but I&#39;ll post them as I go!

				this sounds like a weak fuel pump, TPS, intake air temp sensor, plugged fuel injectors, plugged air filter,<br />&nbsp; as for the cat you could just unbolt it, drive it around the block and go from there.<br /><br />it may just need a general tuneup,<br /><br />for all the sensors you could replace, it might cost over a thousand dollars.<br /><br />have you considered taking it in to a competent mechanic? <br /><br />a reasonable diagnosis fee is about $80, and you may learn a lot.
