				Hey Guys,<br /><br />thanks for your help today. The moped seems to be running a tad better.<br /><br />But, what is weird now, is that if i put the lights on (bright lights-head light) the moped will bogue down when idling, until it dies.<br /><br />A bit weird, as it was not doing that before. Do you think it is related to the fact that the tail light have to be connected (just like last Sunday when it was not running because the electrical was disconnected ?)<br /><br />Any idea, before i connect the tail light ?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Sebastien

				try connecting everything because it is a closed system, meaning everything depends on another thing to work right, dig?

				Jimmy is right, you should hook everything up first and see how it handles that.<br /><br />Also, your lights could be stealing power from your Spark. We could and should (if the first part doesn&#39;t fix it) check your point gap and timing. They aren&#39;t as scary as they sound, haha.<br /><br />Do you have a manual for it?

				Thanks guys.<br /><br />Will try to hook up everything this afternoon.<br /><br />I tried to find the same quick disconnects female, at Home Depot and Auto Zone, but they do not have the small ones. One guy at Auto Zone, said radio Shack maybe ?<br /><br />Well, I will try with the bigger ones, and we&#39;ll see.<br /><br />S.

				Hey guys,<br /><br />I tried to hook every thing up, and well, when I brake, it worked, but the moped dies.<br /><br />As for the head lights, they were working fine yesterday and this morning without making the moped bogue down. But this afternoon, it did it again.<br /><br />Any idea ? Will you help me in letting me know what is going on and how to fix it&nbsp; ?<br /><br />thanks!<br /><br />Sebastien

They refer to the voltage in few lines. Do you think it will be possible to change it ?
