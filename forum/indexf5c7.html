				I&#39;ve been granted permission to buy a GPS for my car.<br /><br />Here&#39;s the deal:<br /><br />I want t a Nuvi 255, and found it for 170 on Amazon, but then I find out that I have $23 in gift card that I wasn&#39;t aware of. <br /><br />Here&#39;s the question: The Nuvi 255W is a inch wider (but otherwise, bascially the same unit) and is around $23 more.<br /><br />So, should I buy the regular version and be ultra-happy with the surprise savings from the gift card? OR<br />Should I forget the extra savings and buy the wider version just to have the wider version?<br /><br />I drive a 5-door hatch that&#39;s fairly small, but average sized.<br /><br />I wonder if the larger screen is really a big difference or necessary.<br /><br />Anyone got advice or wnat to tell me what to do?<br /><br />Alos, I don&#39;t need to buy large items just to compensate for other things I probably should compensate for, so that&#39;s not a part of it.

				we have a regular screen, not the wide screen and have found it to be just fine.&nbsp; We also (well, I) just bought 2 nuvi 260 at circiut city for 135 after tax. I got them for the mopeds but am realizing we really don&#39;t need 2 of them. So if you&#39;re interested I&#39;ll confirm with Jimmy and sell one of the 2 units for 135.00 they are unopened, new in box and zipped plastic.<br />this goes for anyone else too. Garmin makes a bike mount for this model that is 15-20 bucks

				I&#39;ve got a Garmin Quest 2, and it&#39;s got a pretty small screen. On the list of things I don&#39;t like about it, the screen size is pretty far down there. Your screen size is only as good as what the GPS is displaying, and if it&#39;s in the middle of recalculating a route (which it may or may not do quickly) or re-drawing something (which it may or may not do quickly), or if it&#39;s lost satellite reception, then you&#39;re just going to have a bigger screen with no useful information displayed on it. <br /><br />What do you think the biggest advantage of the wider screen is? That it would be easier to see/read? If it&#39;s giving you turn-by-turn directions, those are generally more useful than looking at the screen anyway. If you are easily annoyed by the turn-by-turn directions and you&#39;d prefer to look at your planned route on the map, and then figure it out from there (which I&#39;ve decided is a good plan for mine, since it spends so much time recalculating and not providing any useful information), then the bigger screen might be a plus. <br /><br />Just as a side note... I might be a little biased on this. For the most part, I really like having a GPS, but I&#39;ve discovered their limitations in a very frustrating way. It&#39;s still definitely an imperfect technology, which only becomes more imperfect if you drop it. FYI - don&#39;t drop your GPS.

				I may be interested in that nuvi 260, i would like to look at it first. I am trying to find a gps with a spare/removable&nbsp; battery so I can change if it drains on a moped ride. I the battery internal or removable?

				Yes, but I don&#39;t think that they&#39;re related to me having dropped it. I&#39;ve just learned that routes are only as good as the correlation they have to the real world (as in, you aren&#39;t told to take roads that are closed, and that the GPS actually has the address of where you want to go), and that route recalculation is a pretty worthless feature unless you want to pull over and sit and wait for it to figure out a new (possibly uncorrelated to real life) route for you. As I said, it&#39;s an imperfect technology.

				Thanks for the offer on the 260, but I already ordered the 255W. CRAPOLA!<br /><br />Damn you Circuit City and your closing, you&#39;ve foiled me again! (I went there last night and found NOTHING left except Flip cameras)<br /><br />If there were a perfect technology, I wouldn&#39;t be typing this out on a keyboard.<br /><br />I think I made the right buy, for everyone using this unit, the wider screen will probably be better, especially with two monkeys screaming in your ear about wanting McDonalds or why this trip is taking too long.<br /><br />The only things I ever drop are things that are like they are hot.<br /><br />Never thought of mounting it to the ped...hmm.<br /><br /><br /><br />The use of a compass has become rather obsolete, and sadly so. Anyone who can accurately shoot an azimuth is Aces in my book.

				Good call on the widescreen. I have a 4.3&#39;&#39; widescreen and I couldn&#39;t imagine anything smaller.<br /><br />I got a MIO C320 thought... very hackable. You can put whomevers maps on it you want.

				The compass lacks the zoom feature, its more of a google earth high altitude shot of a map.... there&#39;s the north pole.. theres the south... Never Eat Soggey Waffles..<br /><br />I think GPS makes you ignorant of your surroundings..I pay attention to lefts and rights, landmarks. Shit I made it back to Marks by myself that one night.. I just found highway 55 and took it until I got close to the brewery then it was easy to find the cross streets. I try and stay unlost like 98% of the time.. the other 2 percent I&#39;m fucked up and I just forget for a bit
