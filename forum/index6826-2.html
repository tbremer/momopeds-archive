				Hello,<br /><br />&nbsp; Well, since Ive self appointed myself the THURS nite ride organizer, Ill also play secretary and let thoes who stayed home know what your missing.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Ok Yeah, it rained, but it stopped just in time for the ride! There was a small turnout, even a fella named Mike( there were 3 Mikes acutally, kinda weird) of the BM showed up on his route back home from visiting CHI-town. Awesome guy to talk to, and even better was his tricked out PUCH ! That white work of art was faster than any moped Ive ever seen, slick bike! <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;About 5 of us, (then 4 after John the mailman went home)...rode in Carondolet Park, and then just tooled around the new bike paths that crisscross around town.There was even a cool scooter guy( with&nbsp; optional dispensing beer bag)with an old vespa that rode with us and we learned stuff about scooters and he learned stuff about mopeds. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We rode until like 12 or 1 and it started to sprinkle, so we all went <strong>*&#39;bed ways&#39;</strong> around then...<br /><br /><strong>* A Clockwork Orange Reference, for you milk-plus drinkers out there!</strong><br /><br />At anyrate, despite the rain, we all drank some brews, told stories, maybe learned a thing or 2...<br />thats about all you can expect I suppose.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So yeah , next week, same moped time, same moped park...THURS nite rides- what are you scared of??? The dark?MUuuhahhahhahhaaha! Cause the nite has a thousand eyes!<br /><br /><em><strong>****I will start documenting these rides via film,photos, notes, story boards, etc... as some of you know I am a freelance videographer/ editor, so I will be making a slick ass DVD about the moped scene, and any footage, contributions etc... would be most appreciated!(food for thought)</strong></em>
