				Last weekend rode down to Lucy&#039;s in McBain had a burger and a beer, decent ride.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to ride around to some smaller towns Saturday afternoons or Sunday&#039;s, and when I do I&#039;ll post here if anybody wants to go.&nbsp; This Sunday (8/18) I&#039;m going to ride to Fayette and hit up Emmet&#039;s Kitchen and Tap ( http://www.emmetskitchen.com/ ) it&#039;s about a 30 mile ride up hwy. E to 124, Emmet&#039;s is only open 11-2 on Sunday&#039;s so I&#039;m leaving at 10:30-10:45.&nbsp;

				Sounds fun, I never go to these places normally, even when I feel like driving a car.<br /><br />I will have to exercise some self-control and make myself go home early (i.e., not stay out until 3 am) Saturday. I&#039;m probably going to this show, if anybody&#039;s interested:<br />https://www.facebook.com/events/578406232225474/

				Sweet, more buy in than expected, if I can get a commitment, or two, or four, or more, I would be willing to suggest a slightly different trip, about half the distance.&nbsp; Personally I&#039;d be down for either ride, but Abigails, Rochport ( http://www.abigails-restaurant.com/ ) is also open 11-2 on Sunday and was another ride I was wanting to take anyway.&nbsp; Broadway/Scott&gt;GilispieBridige&gt;UU&gt;O&gt;J&gt;240/40&gt;Central.&nbsp; That&#039;s about an 19 mile trip (one way).&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				I&#039;d say you&#039;d want a fast, solid, reliable, runner.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve never been on theses routes myself, but on street view Hwy 5 looks a bit rough and narrow.

				My van holds a lot of mopeds. Let&#039;s do this. <br /><br />My brother works at a nice Italian restaurant in Springfield which is owned by a friend of mine who rides a BMW or something. Unfortunately, I did say &quot;nice&quot; restaurant, or else he might let us use his party room.

				For some reason texts aren&#039;t coming through on that number (Google voice) my actual number is on the members forum, or if you have an old number for me it&#039;s still good.&nbsp; But even though google says I can get texts on the 636 number they&#039;re not coming in.

				Ok that was an awesome damn ride, and I think you could do 5 /124 just fine on a moped, there was almost no traffic, maybe because everyone was in church.&nbsp; It took us 48 mins to get to Fayette, we rode pretty steady 45-50 m.p.h.&nbsp; We came back W to EE to J to O to UU and I think J would be a bit much for a lot of peds.&nbsp; <br /><br />So Lonnie Ray&#039;s would be an even shorter ride, we drove right through Harrisburg.&nbsp;

				after reviewing the tape the claim of 45-50 steady may have been a bit exaggerated, 29 miles from the shop to Emmet&#039;s average speed 36 mph, max speed 53 mph.
