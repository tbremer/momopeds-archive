				so i was chatting up one of my former prof&#39;s today about mopeds.&nbsp; He&#39;s got a 200cc &#39;78 Vespa scooter (i&#39;m not sure what model) that he totally rebuilt and has been trying for way too long to get titled, with no success.&nbsp; have any of you gone through the titling process in KS? i didn&#39;t think it was terribly difficult-but he seems to think that he&#39;s tried everything.

				For a 200cc scooter, I bet that would be more difficult. We can get away with the whole &quot;I bought it in MO&quot; trick because MO doesn&#39;t title anything under 50cc&#39;s. If it&#39;s over 50cc&#39;s though, MO and just about every other state in the nation will title them, so we can&#39;t pull that trick. I know there are companies that will get you a title and sell them to you, but it ain&#39;t cheap.

				Not that it applies to this situation yet.... But you can register antique vehicles in KS with a bill of sale only (35+ year old vehicles)

				Titling companies, such as:<br /><br />//www.broadwaytitle.com/<br /><br />//www.its-titles.com/lost_vehicle_title.html<br /><br />If you want, I can search/ask over at MA to see if anybody has ever used any companies that they would recommend.

				it&#39;s cool. he said he had looked into some titling services too. i guess the catch is just that it is 200cc. bummer though. i haven&#39;t seen it but i bet it&#39;s rad AS FUCK. (and quick like a bunny!)

				I can do one bike or maybe two,&nbsp; but I&nbsp; think that if I go in there with 4 BOS&#39;s they&#39;re going to be suspicious, especially since I already have 3 titled mopeds. A couple of us could each do one though. <br /><br />Any MO peeps wanna shoot us some bills of sale? We can fill in everything but your signature and address, or if we have unscrouplus (sp?) people like Mike, your address and permission to forge your signature would suffice.

Of course, right now I&#39;m the only person who as actually said they&#39;d go register anything.... of course, I may be the only one with cash too....

				And actually, there&#39;s a dude on MA who wants to trade New Hampshire plates for other state plates. Nash, I assume you don&#39;t care about getting a KS plate -- you just need the actual title, right? Because then we could either keep the KS plates or trade them to the dude in NH, and then we could put the extra plates on loaner bikes and stuff. We probably wouldn&#39;t get hassled by the cops because they&#39;d be plated (I know Dustin doesn&#39;t get hassled, and he&#39;s got a CA plate).
