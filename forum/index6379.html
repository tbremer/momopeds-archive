				the Indian has one of the worst motors put on a moped. not trying to insult you but its a fact. I have been to moped rally&#039;s all over this country and have never seen one. know why? because they all failed due to shitty metal and have no parts available. I would take the bat. I may have room for one more in my car, you&#039;re welcome to ride along. good luck with whatever you decide to do and I hope to see party with you in Herman.
