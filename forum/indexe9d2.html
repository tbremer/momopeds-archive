				alright, heres the sitch. I&#39;m running a stock magnum cylinder and head, with a 14mm bing, 70 jet, and a proma gp pipe. <br /><br />Simple enough, but I can&#39;t seem to make it run right. <br /><br />After seizing the cylinder, crkt and I tore down the top end, and replaced it with a normal stock cylinder. Seized that one within 2 miles of his house. So after some head banging we split the cases and noticed that the small end bearing on the wrist pin seized as well. So we replaced the crank. All bearing are good, and so are the seals. <br /><br />We put it all back together, and after a short test ride today, I seized the magdumb cylinder again! This time it was at the intake port. The first time it seized was on the tranfers. WTF!?<br /><br />Took a look at the plug and there was carbon build up between the terminals. Time to downjet, but I don&#39;t think that downjetting will fix my problem...<br /><br />Any ideas?

				is your gas/oil ratio ok?<br />are you running a fuel filter? maybe your jet is clogging and cutting off the flow.<br />i assume the carb is clean?<br />stock kits are hard to seize ive been trying for a while.

				first time it was off, somewhere like 50:1 or 60:1, but /i drained the tank and put in good a good 40:1 mix. Yes I have a fuel filter... maybe its clogged? <br />and yes the carb is super clean. <br /><br />I have not checked for airleaks yet, but they shouldn&#39;t just apear out of no where right?<br /><br />I can&#39;t check fer airleaks either... The cylinder is going to need to be bored out, or I&#39;m going to have to plop the other stock cylinder on it to get some compression back. <br /><br />Could timing cause this too? crkt and I had to put another stater on it cause the original one was fuct. <br /><br />On the bright side, it has the most amazing stock spark evah!

				no doubt.&nbsp; I am running pretty much the same setup on my freespirit.&nbsp; Stock kit high comp head 14 bing &quot;60 jet&quot;&nbsp; bi turbo and 13x45 gearing and I run it lean as fuck and I cant seize it for the life of me.&nbsp; I think you are seizing so much from letting ryan working on your bike.&nbsp; lol. jay kay.

				Man I&#39;m going to have to agree with Phil with the air leak hypothesis. Check the engine real good for leaks before you take it for the test ride.......

				Just sand your intake down a little on a piece of sandpaper-covered-glass.&nbsp; It should take care of that air leak.
