				So, I fought with timing, gave up, didn&#39;t ride for 5 days because of it, fought with it more, gave up, fought with it more, got it better, but not perfect, rode for 3 days, and now it&#39;s messed up again.<br /><br />I can&#39;t imagine that the stator or points are moving, since I tightened them down hard.&nbsp; I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s actually just the spark plug wire.&nbsp; It&#39;s ripped out of the coil a couple times, and I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s not making a good conection, which is why I have sort of intermittent spark.&nbsp; Maybe?<br /><br />Hitting the auto parts store for some fresh wire today.&nbsp; Hope I make it there...

				You can do a continuity test on the spark wire, HT coil, make sure your connections are right and you aren&#39;t ground out any wheres!<br /><br />I have an extra Bosch HT coil if it isn&#39;t the spark wire...<br /><br />Don&#39;t Puchs have some weird thing where you can&#39;t run them w/o a taillight or something?<br /><br />Bats electrical is fucked up aswell.... :/

				The timing should be perfect as is.&nbsp; Running it advanced, but it didn&#39;t like running at the factory settings (but my setup ain&#39;t factory - so that makes sense).&nbsp; Point gap is to specs.<br /><br />Mine will run fine sans taillight.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t had one hooked up for weeks, and this issue just started on the last Thursday night ride I went on.&nbsp; Only some models/years of Puchs were wired that way.<br /><br />Continuity would be hard to test, since it&#39;s intermittent.&nbsp; It would show continuity most of the time, then fail for a spark or 3, then pick back up.&nbsp; It&#39;s fun when that happens around 45+mph.&nbsp; I feel like a real rodeo cowboy.<br /><br />You know how the wire threads into that pokey deal on the coil, and a similar one of the spark plug cap?&nbsp; I think the wire itself is kinda stretched out so there&#39;s not a real good connection.&nbsp; That&#39;s my theory.&nbsp; I&#39;m gonna try the new cable and see what happens.&nbsp; If it doesn&#39;t work, at least I will have taken one variable out of the equation.

				It&#39;s hard to help someone out that knows everything!&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />Haha, sounds like you&#39;ve got the best plan figured out...<br /><br />How about a PopCycle HT Coil?

				PopCycle ones wouldn&#39;t work.&nbsp; The coil is for a CDI machine, not ye olde points.&nbsp; But the wire itself might work...though if I remember them, they&#39;re real short.

				I want to figure out how to fit the popcycle CDIs on a Puch.&nbsp; I have one sitting around.&nbsp; I looked at it once, and we&#39;d need to make a stator plate mount dealie, all custom-like.&nbsp; It could be done.&nbsp; We&#39;ve got a few of those CDIs I think.&nbsp; Could yank them from those parts bikes too.

				I was joking about the coil, but the wires aren&#39;t terribly short, maybe 5&quot;<br /><br />The csi idea is really great. I&#39;ve been thinking about cdis I want a reliable ignition system

				We need to figure out how to make/adapt one on the cheap.&nbsp; They sell Puch ones, that are hard to come by and like $300 or $400.&nbsp; That&#39;s 2 or 3 more mopeds right there.&nbsp; But according to Malaguti, they&#39;re totally worth it.
