				Yesterday I put a high compression head on my maxi.&nbsp; I took it around the block and didn&#39;t seem to notice much of a difference, but I decided to leave it on.&nbsp; Well riding to work today it proved to be a <em>lot</em> better than the stock head.&nbsp; Acceleration is definitely much better, though I don&#39;t think it changed my top speed at all.<br /><br />So, mill those heads, or buy premade hi-comp ones.&nbsp; Definitely worth it.

				Have you changed to premium fuel?&nbsp; I wonder what the end result compression ratio is.&nbsp; &nbsp;When an engine exceeds a certain compression ratio, you need to upgrade the fuel to premium or you can have pre-ignition or &quot;engine knock.&quot;&nbsp; I always thought of 9.5:1 as requiring regular gas (what&#39;s that? 97 octane?) and 10.5:1 as needing premium, but I don&#39;t know the cutoff between those two.<br /><br />Did the high-compression head say what the compression ratio would end up having?&nbsp; I wonder how one would figure it.&nbsp; <br /><br />First, you can figure displacement mathematically with the cylinder dimensions of bore and stroke.&nbsp; Or you could figure it by connecting a hose to the spark plug hole and run that hose to a graduated (measurement markings on the side) glass container held upside down under water.&nbsp; Then, you would run the piston from bottom dead center to top dead center and measure the air pumped into the glass.&nbsp; But that does not take into account the space above the piston in the head.<br /><br />Second, I wonder how accurate a measurement you would get of just the head by removing it, holding it upside down and filling it with water.&nbsp; Then dump out and measure the water.&nbsp; You would then need to determine if the piston makes it all the way to the top of the cylinder.&nbsp; If not, you must add the volume of the space from the top of the stroke to the bottom of the head.&nbsp; <br /><br />The true compression ratio would be the total volume from the first measurement plus the second compared to the second only.&nbsp; You would call the second measurement &quot;one&quot; and see how many times the second measurement goes into the first.&nbsp; <br />

				We can&#39;t use a jankity 30 year old compression tester?&nbsp; :P&nbsp; I didn&#39;t test the compression before or after the new head, so I think I invalidated any real tests.&nbsp; But we can at least wee what it is now.<br /><br />And it&#39;s been running pretty crappily lately.&nbsp; I need to go through and check the points.&nbsp; It was reccomended using a hotter spark plug with a higher compression setup, so I should try that too.&nbsp; And I&#39;m about out of gas, so I will try premium in the next batch and see if it changes anything.
