				i dont know how the original bats exhausts work did they just slide in then use a clamp to hold them in? if that is the case then i guess i need to pull what ever looks broken on my exhaust port out??<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;i&nbsp; m sorry i see flanges on all the exhaust sides of the exhaust systems and there isnt any way to bolt my exhaust to my cylinder so, since this is my first attempt at restoration of a moped i assumed that since the piece that was there originally is broken off i would find an aluminum flange and weld it with some bolts back to the exhaust port, i have 2 bolt steel flanges at the shop i work at but steel cant weld to aluminum, the only other option (but i am open to ideas) is to buy a new cylinder head and weld a steel flange to my stock exhaust??? but again this is my first restore and i dont know anything about mopeds ....&nbsp;

				yeah you are completly right part 56, 57 and 58 in the wiki page there is no flange just clamps i feel dumb, i think i can figure it out now, im still looking for piston rings if any one knows a dealer or has extra ones i might be able to buy.. another stupid question here if i can find a 44 mm ring and it doesnt fit perfectly i can grind it down a little right???
