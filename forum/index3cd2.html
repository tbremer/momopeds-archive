				I put this on mopedarmy, but I thought I might as well ask you here too - <br /><br />My Tomos A3 (dellorto 14mm carb) only wants to run when I hold the choke lever almost all the way down. I&#39;ve cleaned the carb 4 times, flushed the tank, put on a fuel filter etc. It all used to run fine a few years ago. It&#39;s all stock as far as I know. Anybody have some ideas of what I can do? Or some other jets that I could try out in case someone changed this one at some point?

				Brian,<br /><br />I have been thinking about your problem and would like you to try something I saw at a moped/citizenship/music/fun/outing/ride/meet scooterists BBQ this weekend.&nbsp; Close off your intake by half.&nbsp; Mike suggested taping half of the air coming into the carb for a Chinese scooter at the BBQ because he KNEW it made it (the PopCycle) perform better.&nbsp; You need to try this.&nbsp; You can duct tape over half of your screen filter or maybe put a half-circle of cardboard on the side of the screen filter AWAY from the carb (so it does not get sucked into the carb.&nbsp; In fact, put the duct tape on the side away from the engine.<br /><br />Next, read an article I will post as a new thread here in the repair forum.&nbsp; I&#39;ll title it &quot;Carb Tuning&quot; but I think we need to figure out how it applies to your problem.&nbsp; This is especially true if taping half the intake helps.&nbsp; The article is about tuning motorcycle carburetors, and mopeds do not have nearly as many adjustments.&nbsp; We need to put together the idea that taping helps with the&nbsp; article and see if we can apply the motorcycle technology to simpler moped carburetors.&nbsp; It could be multiple plug chops will help us understand your problem.&nbsp; Read the posting and you will see what I mean.<br /><br />I don&#39;t have a solution yet, but if we put our heads together with the facts in the article, we might figure out something that will help mopeds.<br /><br />Dave

				Brian,<br /><br />I just re-read your post.&nbsp; You said you have a Dellorto 14mm carb.&nbsp; I think you need to re-post on mopedarmy and ask if this is a normal size and brand carb for a Tomos A3.&nbsp; The Tomos I had (and sold) had a different brand of carb.&nbsp; I had the one in the service manual I gave to you.&nbsp; It&#39;s pictured on page 22.&nbsp; I do not have a record of what size mine was, but I wonder if it was as big as 14mm.<br /><br />I say this because my Vespa has a 12mm carb and I think 12mm is the original size for a Puch (which has a Bing carburetor).&nbsp; Mike would know for sure.&nbsp; Anyway, your Dellarto seems big to me.&nbsp; Post a question on the repair section of mopedarmy asking anyone else with a dellarto carb what size it is.&nbsp; Or email Mike at mijunkin@gmail.com.&nbsp; If you are posting on MopedArmy, first, see if you can read the numbers without disassembling the moped.&nbsp; People are not going to drop their engine to tell you their carb size.&nbsp; Tell them in the post where the numbers are that you want to read.&nbsp; If the engine must be dropped to read them, you have to hope people already read them and know what they have.&nbsp; Be sure to specify that you need people with the Dellarto carb.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know where the cutoff is between a Tomos A3 and a Tomos A35 and I don&#39;t know the differences between the two.&nbsp; You could research that by looking at the pictures of Tomos mopeds at mopedarmy.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;m all wrong and yours is an A35.&nbsp; Is the carb the difference?&nbsp; I don&#39;t know.&nbsp; I only know mine had that different brand of carb that&#39;s on page 22.&nbsp; If no one reports having a Dellarto carb, then, someone installed a different brand carb on YOUR moped.&nbsp; Maybe the first step is to see if you can slip on a smaller carb.&nbsp; Some mopedders in our group might have a smaller Dellarto, since they obviously fit.&nbsp; That might be worth a try.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dave<br /><br />

				Hi Dave,<br /><br />Thanks so much for your ideas. Actually, I was going to do just that with the duct tape. I had also wanted to ask if anybody had different sized jets, because themopedjunkyard.com makes a big point about not adding a bigger jet to this carb. I think it recommends a #51, though I haven&#39;t taken mine apart to see what&#39;s in it since I learned the nomenclature. <br /><br />In answer to your question, the later A3s had this carb, and the earlier ones had a different one. This is definitely the right carb for my moped. By the way, if anybody&#39;s looking for a performance carb, there&#39;s a guy on ebay who sells them and all kinds of other parts, and he&#39;s willing to deal if you offer him less than he&#39;s asking. For instance, he was asking $70 + shipping for a performance carb for my moped, and was willing to take $62 for it incl. shipping. Not bad. However, I&#39;m not going to get it because according to mopedjunkyard, you can&#39;t upgrade the carb unless you upgrade the cylinder and intake on the A3. <br /><br />I&#39;ll try the tape on the air intake. Anybody have some dellorto jets I could try out? With a bigger jet, it stands to reason I might get more power, since I have enough air. But cutting back the air seems like it would give me less power. Or does that make no sense? Still lots to learn. <br /><br />And I need to get some new spark plugs so I can try out your test, Dave. However, my one concern is that when using gas/oil mixture, the spark plug color may not be eggshellwhite, since (at least on my plugs) it&#39;s always been somewhat oily and brownish colored. <br /><br />Brian

				Also, if someone else has a working Dellorto SHA 14mm carb I could try out, that would be great, just to see if for some reason it&#39;s this carb that&#39;s the problem. <br /><br />And I need a RH Domino brake lever, and a mirror, but I can order those. <br />

				Brian,<br /><br />When you check plug color, look at the porcelian below the contacts.&nbsp; Don&#39;t worry about the metal around the outer edge or the contacts themselves.&nbsp; The porcelain gets hottest when the engine runs and that&#39;s when the color is developed.&nbsp; <br /><br />You might have heard of different &quot;heat range&quot; of plugs.&nbsp; A hotter plug just has a longer porcelain.&nbsp; It goes up higher into the metal around the outside of the plug (inside the threads) before it is bonded to the metal.&nbsp; That means it cannot dump its heat as easily as one that contacts the outside metal just barely inside the threaded metal.&nbsp; So it&#39;s the porcelain that develops the most heat and can burn to the proper color.&nbsp; <br /><br />I see your thoughts on the oil in the gasoline causing a darker tint to the porcelain color.&nbsp; The article is talking about motorcycles.&nbsp; Some do and some don&#39;t burn oil with the gasoline, but I think the article is talking about big bikes that don&#39;t burn oil with the gas so I assume they would have a lighter color.&nbsp; The oil does cause oily deposits on the metal at the end of the threads for sure and could be darkening the porcelain as well.<br /><br />Dave

				I was talking with a motorcycle mechanic the other day, who was fixing up some mopeds for someone. He stated emphaticly that these old peds from the 70&#39;s get crank seal leakage, and that throws all the sizing, jetting, tuning stuff for a loop.&nbsp; Mark

				which ever seal that would make the compression leak... he was working on hobbits, I was thinking it may not be as critical on a non-case induced set up.....I&#39;m wondering if setting up a compression testor , to read the exhaust would tell on it....

				after doing a little search on MA, I noticed that poor idling is beig blamed on crankshaft seals, to me, it would make sense that the vaccum stroke would lean the mix, and with the fact that we have, some 14psi, atomspheric pressure helping it leak, jetting up would help this? is that right? wastes gas, and clogs stuff up in the exhaust,,,any thought?
