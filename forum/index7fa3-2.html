				i?m gonna regret this probably, but fuck it. i do this every winter.<br /><br />alright, up for grabs: SUPER RATTY magnum frame/seat/tank/sidecovers. perfect start for a magnum project. a fucking RATTY one.<br /><br />the pics speak for themselves. the petcock on the tank is new from treats. tank is rusty as hell inside but im pretty sure it doesnt leak at all. i DO have the rubber thing the tank sits on and i DO have that plastic piece that goes under the sidecovers. all the tabs for mounting the engine covers were broken off, also the mount for the rear fender is missing. forgot to take a picture of the rack, but i have it too, although its completely bent and fairly rusty.<br /><br />make me an offer. i know there are dudes out there, like me, that couldnt find a magnum for the life of them. but nowadays, im letting my motorcycles be the toptanks, and my mopeds be step-throughs, so i?m kinda over this. im looking for puch performance stuff, or other cool shit. i have two mopeds ahead of this one that i need to finish before spring, so i gotta get rid of this.<br /><br />i never had the original forks or swingarm. what you see is what you get! pick up preferred or for a little extra i could meet you somewhere probably. magnum frames are fucking heavy and i dont really want to ship this at all.<br /><br />DONT ASK ME TO SELL SEPERATE PARTS. ITS ALL OR NOTHING!<br /><br />(http://www.divshare.com/img/display/10411186-d70)<br />(http://www.divshare.com/img/display/10411187-b71)<br />(http://www.divshare.com/img/display/10411188-f5a)<br />(http://www.divshare.com/img/display/10411189-b3e)<br />(http://www.divshare.com/img/display/10411190-af0)<br />(http://www.divshare.com/img/display/10411191-915)<br />(http://www.divshare.com/img/display/10411192-eca)<br /><br />no pedal cranks, i need them for my freespirit project.<br /><br />also heres a pic from when it was together last year:<br />(http://www.divshare.com/img/display/7186500-807)<br /><br />
