				I&#39;m thinking of letting the copper Moby go.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the timing has slipped on it, and it has some airleaks.&nbsp; Needs a new cylinder or somebody who can fix the airleak at the exhaust header.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would be up to trade for a running puch, or about $300 cash.&nbsp; Anybody interested?

				i&#39;ve got a soft spot in my heart for puchs... you would have the sweetest puch if you had electrical assist on it.&nbsp; you&#39;d never bend out clutch posts or tear up the clutch pads (at least not as quickly).

				You&#39;ve ridden it before so you know how she is.&nbsp; Tank is a little rusty but I&#39;ve never had the bike torn down enough to shake the insides.&nbsp; Since you are going to go wild with it, might as well give it the love it deserves.&nbsp; This bike sits most of the year and ALWAYS starts.&nbsp; One killer stocker!<br /><br />Oh if you decide to get rid of the stock cylinder on that baby, I&#39;d like to take it off your hands.

				I&#39;m going to rock it stock for a while and get the feel of the regular machine.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then throw a hubmotor on the front when I have time to lace a wheel and gear up the gas engine to see how much speed I can get on 50cc.&nbsp;

				Dude, that&#39;s the cylinder to do with!&nbsp; It has some good low end now but I imagine that you&#39;ll throw a different pipe on it.&nbsp; It&#39;s be rad to see what the Ancient Chinese Secret pipe would do on that.&nbsp; Have the electric pull you into the pipe and fly!
