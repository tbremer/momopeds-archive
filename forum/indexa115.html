				I looked at two Indians today in Wentzville. One was an 80 that needed some work and I&#039;m not sure what year the other was. They both were red with the rainbow striping. The second one was a running pedal that I was told topped at around 25.

				Thats her.&nbsp; Seems whomever stole it couldnt get it started so they ditched it on the side of the road.&nbsp; Ofallon decided it was an abandoned vehicle and had it impounded.&nbsp; Budget wont release it tho, since he doesnt have a title (bought it off ebay back in september).&nbsp; Even tho he can point out all the aftermarket work done to it, i guarantee its only 1 of 2 indians in the world with my easily identifiable custom made copper head gaskets made with hacksaw and metal files..<br /><br />Guess the only way he can get it back is wait for it to go to police auction and hope he has enough spare money to buy his own bike..

				yeah.. he tried gettin ahold of the person he got it from.&nbsp; Ebay only goes back 6 months tho and he cannot find the info.&nbsp; Hes going to try the police report and see if that helps, needs something with the vin number on it.&nbsp; Might be better off gettin it at auction at this point.. cant imagine what the storage fees are up to.<br /><br />

				since MO doesnt issue titles for these bikes you should be able to find some loop hole.&nbsp; Find a local politician to talk to and try to get them to help you out.-ther has to be someone that will syphasize with your predicatmate.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see how abandone vheicle ordainces can apply to a &quot;vehicle&quot; that does not require licese or insurance, sort of like witholding a bicycle.-I am drunk and can&#039;t find spell check.

				Always take pictures of your bikes and keep them updated&nbsp; Just incase shit happens&nbsp; &nbsp; and moped insurance is so cheep why not pay a few bucks a month just to cover your ass.&nbsp; &nbsp;I suggest you go and steal your bike from the impound lot apparently without a title the cops can&#039;t do shit<br />
