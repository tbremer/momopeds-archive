				&nbsp;What are the facts on two stroke oil for vintage mopeds? What the best and worst? Is synthetic better then regular? Are there bad synthetic oils? Is marina synthetic better then other synthetics? Are there 2 stroke oils that can cause false seizures in vintage motors? does they type of two stroke really matter that much? Is it all hype? Whats the skinny? For the old school guys what type of two stroke do you prefer in your moped if money is no object?

Please don&#39;t run marine two-stroke oil. Yes, the type of two-stroke oil really matters.

That&#39;s the beauty of low-displacement economy. Though, in my Magnum, which got around 40mpg, I still bought the highest quality that was available to me: Motul 800 double ester. The difference between 1 liter of Motul and a liter of the worst quality stuff I&#39;d run is only $10. That&#39;s really negligible, especially in the game of expensive kits and frequent rebuilds. I like to have as little top-end problems as I can get away with. I&#39;ve never seized. But I&#39;m apparently just a dumb, immature kid that hasn&#39;t grown up to real motors yet, so take this all with a grain.<br />

				Man... I run the shittiest 2-stroke I can find...Im dead serious, ask anyone. There is some scientific reasoning to it, but I wont get into it, but it has to do with having a little friction to properly hone out the cylinder. I suppose once its broke in I could switch to some synthetic, but I just grab whatever I see at 7-11 or auto zone. If I happen into Honda I occasionaly buy the good stuff.<br /><br />

				&quot;Scientific reasoning&quot;, huh? Get into it man, this is the place for that. Why would you want to &quot;hone out&quot; your cylinder when you ride? I feel like that seriously reduces the life of your cylinder and rings. There&#39;s already a &quot;little friction&quot;, actually a LOT of friction inherent in a running motor. There are also a lot of bad by-products of running shitty oil, like ring sticking and excessive carbon buildup (and Biery seizing his Airsal in Austin). Non-synthetic also tends to gum up components like power valves, we don&#39;t have those, but it does mean that all that shit gets pushed to your pipe. Also, I just feel it&#39;s a bit boorish to throw shit oil at nice components. Why half ass? It&#39;s these reasons that I run a good synthetic. It actually doesn&#39;t burn, so it stays suspended in the charge after combustion, and goes straight out the pipe because it&#39;s still atomized. I&#39;ve never had to clean a piston due to carbon (and people like Mike P have picked on me because of how much oil I ran in the MK), and I&#39;ve never had ring sticking problems.<br /><br />Now, as for running non-synth during break-in, then switching back to syn afterwards.. I&#39;ve never done this. I break in on the oil that I ride with. We can get in to break-in techniques, but mine have nothing to do with oil. Just a few heat/rpm cycles to get things mated and seated, then I ride it normally (tuning comes before riding, and I work a few heat/rpm cycles in when tuning). Again, never had any blowby or excessive wear issues. But let&#39;s not get into break-in, we can start another thread for that.

				ive been using the lucas semi-synthetic. ran quite a bit better than the shitty mower stuff. i liked it, but may swap to full synthetic once i get a decent kit on the vespa and get it going. <br /><br />but really. mix it and make sure you have enough. too much is bad, not enough is worse. <br /><br />did 25:1 in the puch by accident once and it just clogged the exhaust baffle. not enough in the MK and it soft siezed. easier to clean up a clogged mess than a melted one.

				25:1 or more, my brother put too much in and told me he didnt put any in. so i put in the normal amount of oil. but it was a fully stock bike with crap oil and gas. probably coincidence, but was really gummed up and clogged after that tank. no biggie

				No need to patronize. When you dump so much time and money into these little bikes as we do, I think they become more than &quot;just mopeds&quot;. If you think you can half-ass and &quot;voodoo&quot; your way with a motor, that&#39;s fine. Just don&#39;t give out tuning advice.

				Here is my crapy advice. Check your motor let it be the judge . At lease 2 times a year pull the head off and cylinder off clea it all realy good polish the exaust port as smoth as you can get it. Take your rings off and make shure and this is very inportant to clean out the ring grouves if you have a build up under there or on the sides of it your rings are restricted and can not move in and out like they should and yes they do go in and out .This will kill your motor for shure. Even th owners manual will tell ya to clean it all .then you should use new rist pin clips if you take them off.

				Ok Justin, do you need attention? Well, go to MA if you wanna start drama, cause we dont need it here. Trying to tell me what to say and not say is a BAD idea, Ill leave it at that. You wanna come to a rally, see my peds and talk shit to my face, go ahead, actually -I would have more respect for you if you did. But as of now, you sound like a troll just trying to go back and forth on the net. Good times. And Im not going to respond to your snippy bitchy essay rant that you will try to use to &#39;win friends and influence your neighbors&#39;... just remember I will read it and I will see you at some point, so choose how you speak to me very carefully.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yeah, I don&#39;t need attention. I&#39;m not even trying to start drama. I&#39;m honestly just trying to get good information out. I know what peds you&#39;ve built, and I think they&#39;re cool. I&#39;m not talking shit on YOU; again, I just don&#39;t like bad information. Do what you want with your own bikes; AGAIN, I just don&#39;t like bad information. As far as my snippy, bitchy essay rants.. Well, I guess that&#39;s just how educated people communicate. Be on the level. I&#39;m just trying to defend what I know. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve &quot;forgotten more than I&#39;ll ever know&quot;, seems like everybody has these days, but I come from years of 2t karting, autocross, and HPDEs, and I had the fastest bike at the last two rallies I went to, so I&#39;m not just talkin&#39; dat bullshit.

Your choice in oil can vary. when youve got crummy oil, you seem to get more carbon build up from my experience. but then again, i dont see the need to run double ester in my stock bike. if i had an expensive kit? yeah. id do what i could to make it last as long as possible.

				OMG. Seriously guys? Is this REALLY worth arguing about? <br /><br />Jimmy has an opinion about oil. His opinion leads him to actions that have worked well for him. Justin has an opinion about oil. His opinion leads him to actions that have worked well for him. <br /><br />Yes, Justin, you can back up your opinion with well-reasoned paragraphs involving lots of science-y stuff. That&#39;s cool, and I know we all appreciate what a great resource you and your technical knowledge are. Jimmy is entitled to his opinion on oil, though, and he has built really nice bikes, so it isn&#39;t like he&#39;s some annoying noob trying to pretend like he knows what he&#39;s talking about. I know you read it like he was trying to pass along bad info, but he&#39;s just saying, &quot;This is what I do, and it works for me.&quot; It&#39;s one thing to discuss the merits of oil and challenge each other&#39;s opinions. I view a lot of what&#39;s going on here as ad hominem arguments though, and that makes you both wrong. This has gone from a discussion of opinions and information about oil into a stupid 5th grade bickering match, and it needs to stop.

				I&#39;ve been running Maxima2 50:1, and I&#39;ve never had any problems at all. I&#39;m running a stock cylinder but pushing it pretty hard. One day after some blasting on a fresh build my carb was stupidly unshimmed, literally rattling around my intake. Serious air leak. and I made it without smearing my piston all over the cylinder. <br /><br />The viscosity of the maxima is a bit weird, kinda thin. But it&#39;s the only high performance synthetic I could get locally. So there ya go.

				Why stay away from Castor, just curious? Also, why not marine? Lay some science on me!<br /><br />I ran Lucas Semi-Syn for a long time (before that I ran Marine, yeah!), and I have switched over to Motul for at least 1 Quart&#39;s worth. I can get it (700) for about $12. So it&#39;s $4 more than Lucas. It is way way way way less ashy &amp; less smoky. Other than that I haven&#39;t noticed any difference I ran it at 60:1 in my Polini.<br /><br />That being said, I won&#39;t go as far as Justin does. If I don&#39;t have my oil on me at the gas station I&#39;ll buy the cheap shit and run it. Until I can get back to my oils. At which point I drain my tank and give it to Loren. ;)

				Stay away from castor because it&#39;s a non-synthetic bean oil. It&#39;s VERY VERY good as an oil, really good lubrication, good dwell time, AND you can mix it with alcohol (not that that matters much, some of the kart guys I ran with used castor, and they ran Ethanol). The thing is, it doesn&#39;t burn very clean. It leaves carbon gunk CAKED on your crown and head, and gums up rings really fast if you&#39;re not careful. The only reason the kart guys got away with it was because they did a full top end rebuild after every weekend, and replaced the rings every weekend. I really wouldn&#39;t use it on a moped, because, unlike a really high quality synthetic, it&#39;s overkill. You&#39;d KNOW if you had an engine that required castor; which, in today&#39;s world of really good oils, there aren&#39;t that many that really do. I ran Motul Kart Gran Prix 2t, and never had wear issues compared to the castor guys, and didn&#39;t have to clean near as much at the end of the weekend. I&#39;ve found that Castor is a REALLY good assembly oil, because it stays coated to components longer, good for that first start :)
