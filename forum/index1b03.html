				Bought a urban parts bike in Jan. from denver.&nbsp; There was a lot of stuff there but missing all the little things and not so little like brake cables,throttle cable, headlight, better seat, misc. and bits and pieces, the things you need.&nbsp; Just got around to see if I can get it going ... all the usual stuff and more, got motor mounted and running, box O&#39;parts on the way.&nbsp; Wiring harness is a nutcase so I will simplify to basic headlight and brakelight, horn and on/off whatever it takes to make it legal .&nbsp; &nbsp;Using the 14&quot; rear from my other since I went with 16 on that, and new front tire.&nbsp; If the parts get here I can start to finish up on it, hopefully soon so I can get it runnng to drive.&nbsp; &nbsp;right now its a garage ornament that makes noise.&nbsp;

				well it is road worthy right now, put cables, tires everything to make it work and rideable.&nbsp; I&#39;ve taken it for miles n miles ride.&nbsp; Although it is stock right now I want to do upgrade stuff but I have other issues to get out of the way first.&nbsp; I have the wiring hooked up very basic like for bench testing no battery / on/off switch thats it.&nbsp; What I&#39;m wanting to do is run like that only with headlight, brake light and maybe horn + on/off bypassing the battery altogether.&nbsp; So if anyone has knowledge in these matters and could help great&nbsp; (I&#39;ve got the schematics ).<br />&nbsp; I want to do away with everything that is not needed as far as the wiring and switches..&nbsp; I see this on other bikes certainly it can be done here right?&nbsp; Theres just so much darn many wires I don&#39;t want all that.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;gonna take the signal tees off the front and everything else off the front fork ceptin the horn and going to a round headlight,&nbsp; lookin for a tank for a top mount and do away with the rear mount/luggage/light tree crap and just cut it off after the seat!! hehe&nbsp; Anyone want to drink beer and play with wiring?
