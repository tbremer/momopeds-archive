				Umm... Don&#39;t bother... I did some math.<br />My M48 pulley, though larger, has a 13t sprocket. <br />The 102, while smaller, has an 11t. <br />When ya crunch numbers, the two setups are very close to the same. <br />a 102 pulley with a 13t (or even a 12t) would be better.&nbsp; Do those exist?<br /><br />There are some dinky spacing issues too, but nothing that can&#39;t be overcome.

				There are larger sprockets for the pug pulleys, the 102, 103, 104 all use the same one...

				Next issue: belts.&nbsp; I used a random online calculator to determine what new belt to get. The result it gave was wrong. (Wrong info on the web! is that even possible?) So I figured it all out. Here&#39;s my formula:<br /><br />BL= ((D-d)/tan(theta)) + pi/2(D + d + (theta/90)*(D-d))<br /><br />Where: <br />theta = sin^-1((D-d)/2C)<br />D = Large pulley diameter<br />d = Small pulley diameter<br />C = distance between pulley centers<br /><br />V belts are sold in inches so maybe do yr measurements in inches. <br />The length printed on a belt is it&#39;s outside length. <br />Think about this when making your measurements<br /><br />My bat had a 3L310 on it.&nbsp; The fist three means it&#39;s 3/8&quot; wide on the outside. the L310 means it is 31.0&quot; long. a 4LXXX belt is 1/2&quot; wide (4/8&quot;). Neat.<br />

				I just took a piece of rope and wrapped it around the pulleys, then took it with me and measured it on the belt measuring thing at westlakes.... your getting all fancy an shit with that math stuff

				I was sitting at a professional meeting all week with tons of time on my hands and a pad of paper. If I&#39;d been at home I would have used a piece of rope too. <br />Without reference materials I had to go back to basic principles. I had to prove to myself that cos (theta) = sin (90-theta). I had to derive the Law on Sines from scratch. Ug. I could have used a piece of rope right then to hang myself with. I dropped out of engineering school in 1995 fer chrissakes.

				Okay. I got the Pug 13t sprocket and a&nbsp; 3L290 belt. Slapped the 102 pulley on. I killed the low. Dead dead dead. But when my silly pipe finally kicks in at around thirty, it is on! I was hitting 35 in the neighborhood, kept running out of road. I guess I need to take it out for a cruise, see what this new setup can do, or if it is worth the hassle considering the loss of low end power. Maybe split the diff and get a 12t. Dunno yet. But it works so I&#39;m pumped.

				The gearing is a bit too high. Rideable but not fun. Top end is marginally better though. Gonna try a 12t next.
