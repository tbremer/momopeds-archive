			<strong>calizarr</strong>:
			<br />
			So, fun times in Maplewood, I got an excessive noise violation while riding my urban express on Manchester and therefore have a court date AND need to get a baffle for it before then (mine just fell off at some point and I couldn&#039;t find it.) Anyone have any suggestions/recommendations? Know about a way I can fight this in court?<br /><br />Thanks.

			That sucks, I had that happen two weeks ago. (the baffle falling off, not the ticket luckily). I was luck enough to recover the silencer, and then I paid someone to weld it back on.

			I ended up getting the Simonini baffle and paid my court costs, so no actual fine but still annoying. Otherwise, the baffle works really well.
