			Welcome back pioneers!<br /><br />&nbsp;Did you see any new species? Forge any unchartered territories??... break any hearts???...&nbsp; etc ...etc...<br />At any rate, the Hobbitt is up and running, really&nbsp; well, but I think my wife wants it now...go figure...so now Im looking for a new project. Im eyeing a dual purpose vintage 1970 Honda CT90- very cool step through no- ped, or a vintage Indian moped(1960?), going to Salena KS to visit an old motorcycle museum a guy is starting to sell stuff he had in the back. Just talked to him last nite for hours-great guy! At any rate, if anyone wants to tag along, let me know, Im going THURS.<br /><br />SO yeah thats it ::)<br /><br />-J.

			The rally was amazing, surprisingly disorganize but incredibly inspiring. Riding with SO many mopeds was out of this world. Riding with so many kitted mopeds was totally humbling but I know gave the four of us a renewed enthusiasm towards our projects.The new possible peds sound awesome will you be bringing them to fix it day Sunday? Mike and Alex bought a Garelli Super Sport for $100 while we were in KZoo wait till you feast your eyes on it .....beautiful I tell you beautiful.

			Good to hear, I may bring one, depends on a few things, yeah and the indian is a 1980 by the way not 1960, I dont even think indian made a moped except for four years in the early eighties, and what a decade that was, ahhh the neon, the hairspray, the gaudy colors- whatever, Im over it- totally!<br /><br />-J.<br /><br />PS <br /><br />&nbsp;I hear rumors we are meeting at the Venice cafe, this SUN??? Is this true?<br />

			The trip was incredible.&nbsp; You can&#39;t even try to describe what it&#39;s like to ride with 250 or so other mopeds.&nbsp; You just need to do it, and you won&#39;t regret it.&nbsp; I hope we get a ton of I.R.E. riders out to the Kansas City rally, and I know some of us want to go to Chicago too.<br /><br />I attached a pic some dude on a kitted bike took as he flew by me.<br /><br />More pics here: //photonele.com/gallery/v/kzoo/<br />And here: //s239.photobucket.com/albums/ff248/mycider/Kzoo%202008/?albumview=slideshow<br />Some video here: //www.mopedarmy.com/forums/discuss/read.php?f=1&amp;i=511554&amp;t=510582
