				Also, this would be a prime opportunity for those of us who have acquired footie pajamas to wear them. Or we can wear our cheesiest Christmas sweaters. Or some combination of the above. <br /><br />I vote for a white elephant gift exchange, (a) because it&#39;s cheap, (b) because there is potential for ridiculousness, and (c) I get to use my fancy present-wrapping skills to wrap something crappy and mostly worthless, which appeals to my sense of irony.

				OK, we&#39;re fairly settled on Sunday the 18th, right? How does 4 pm sound? I&#39;m bringing mesquite grilled chicken breast and burgers (and would be grateful for an approximate head count). Format for the gift exchange still needs to be agreed upon.

				Becca, it&#39;d be great if you can come, and if I can help with rides or anything, just lemme know. Maybe we should say 3, on the assumption that Becca&#39;s other party is at night? <br /><br />And I can bring dessert.

				The Christmas Party will be December 18th at 4 pm. Grilled checken and burgers are being provided. Please bring some sort of side dish or dessert. The gift exchange is as follows: Bring one wrapped moped related item. It can be used, but not used up. If you want or need to buy an item, limit it to $10 or less. Anyone who brings a gift will draw for a gift. It will be a random draw, so you won&#39;t be selecting a gift for a specific person.&nbsp; After all the gifts are drawn for and unwrapped, there will be a swap. If you see something you like better than what you got, try to get the other person to trade. Make as many trades as you like. The main idea here is for everyone to get something they can use, so no gag gifts. The gift exchange is optional. See you there.

				It is a nice idea, but I&#39;m worried that by limiting it to moped-related items, we&#39;ll get a lot of brand-specific stuff that only one person can use. Maybe it&#39;s just me, but pretty much any moped parts I have lying around are junk, or if they&#39;re still decent, they fall in the category of &quot;nobody would want this for any reason.&quot; In other words, I don&#39;t see a lot of people getting things out of this that they can use, so if we&#39;re gonna get mostly useless stuff, we may as well have some fun with it in the process. Just my opinion, though. Brett at least has ideas that aren&#39;t meant to undermine the rules, so maybe I&#39;m wrong. I&#39;m certainly down to pack up what I&#39;ve got and try out this &quot;being nice&quot; thing (as opposed to &quot;being crass/ridiculous&quot;).<br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;m in, and I think I&#39;ve finally talked Devin into coming to a moped event, particularly since we aren&#39;t riding (right?) and the whole &quot;not having a properly working moped&quot; thing makes coming to rides a little harder.

				Linda, you make a good point. Let me talk to Kevin about this. A &quot;useful moped related item&quot; gift exhange was mostly his idea and I agreed it was a good one. The idea was that everyone would get something they could use. Hopefully, we can come up with a concept everyone is happy with. Thanks for the input.

				OK, Linda and I have agreed that the gift exchange will remain as a&nbsp; &quot;useful moped related item&quot;. As mentioned earlier, spend up to $10 if you don&#39;t have something that works. Anything Puch is pretty universal. If you absolutely can&#39;t make this work, then a considerate mopedder friendly gift is appropriate.&nbsp; &nbsp;
