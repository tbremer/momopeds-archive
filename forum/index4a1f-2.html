				OK, so most rides we do are short and we go around the same loop everytime (when I ride at least.) Who&#39;d be interested in a longer ride? maybe to Lawrence for lunch and back, I dunno, it&#39;d be a good practice run for the st. louis rally and for those of us who are going to LA.<br /><br />Linda, yes...you would have to come to KC, leave your car. ride to lawrence and back, then drive to lawrence again.<br /><br />Chuck and Matt, don&#39;t be scared to go to Kansas, you&#39;re perfectly legit with a MO driver&#39;s license.<br /><br />Kevin and Bangers this would be a great test for our bikes before we hit LA.<br /><br />Mike

				I&#39;m down. But I&#39;m out of town next weekend. Unless its this Saturday or Sunday I aint gonna be able to do it.<br /><br />Bry said something about organizing this. I&#39;d be down for doing it after we come back from LA... its only 3 weeks away... awsomeness. The ped I have in LA is gonna be in great shape, and I ordered a pipe for it. Minarelli V1 with a ported intake and 14.12 carb with an upjet, and the pipe. Should ride somewhere mid 30&#39;s or low 40&#39;s. Nothing too special, just wanna hang with the pack. <br /><br />Anyways this weekend? YES..

				I&#39;m worried, KS cops are dicks. I&#39;ll have to take the fast moped... umm I forgot which one is the fastest agian.. dammit.<br /><br />I wanna see what Linda has to say. If we left from KC we could ride to Lawrence on Saturday/Sunday we could hang out for a few hours, turn around and come back. Dont know if this weekend will work for anyone but even if its just me and Mike I&#39;d still be down.

				I remember all the police interference with all of the other Kansas rides, oh wait it never happened. Act legal, be legal, no worries. Confusing the Mission Hills P.D. with the rest of Kansas is wrong. If the weather will cooperate, the Dude abides.

				I lived in Kansas (state) for 16 years, and got out as soon as i got a drivers license.<br />now every time i cross the border i get anxiety attacks, i fucking HATE Kansas!<br />&nbsp;and&nbsp; &quot;Rent-a-cops, I hate Rent-a-cops too!&quot; (men at work if yea didn&#39;t know)<br />side note to Kevin &quot;mid 30s to low 40s&quot; did you recently lose some weight, like 70 lbs?<br />I got the honda express to hit 41 mph on a stock 50cc cylinder (heavily ported, with a techno estoril, 14mm mikuni, and hi flow filter)<br />but it took about a city block to get there, and going up hills was out of the question.<br />so unless you have a 70cc cylinder in there you might want to adjust your numbers.

				Matt the Minarelli already did 30 when I bought it. Its super torquie and that was all stock. I figure with a pipe and an upjet it should be at least 35.. hoping for more like 40. The city bike rips, I&#39;ll show you when I bring it back from LA...City bike is no Honda express, Italian shit is the bomb.<br /><br />So maybe we do this, this weekend? I&#39;d be down for it

				I dont have any fast peds. I&#39;d have to make it a slow ride, but pending weather I&#39;d go. Maybe I could ride the yeller puch, its probably the fastest right now. Maybe scott would wanna be the case car since I am gonna spend this evening and Saturday trying to help him build a complete ped. Maybe he will even have it put together by Sunday. Either way I&#39;d like to leave my place? (meet there?) leave from there? I&#39;d like to do it earlier, it will be colder but it will provide us a good mid day ride for the most part. <br /><br />I think everyone has everyones number right? I&#39; dont have bangers number...

				I said this to Kevin, but I&#39;ll say it here too. I am sick, and I&#39;m not going anywhere this weekend. Honestly, riding next week is probably unrealistic as well. It&#39;s possible I would be better enough to drive reconnaissance next weekend, but I&#39;ll have to see.&nbsp; (And yes, I know that means I would drive to KC, then drive/ride to Lawrence, then drive/ride back to KC, then drive home to Lawrence.)<br /><br />Bryan said something about organizing something like this for April, but that&#39;s not going to help you out for the rally. If we wanted to do it all together, we could wait and see if he&#39;ll do it then, and then you guys who want to run your bikes could go out now. Or you could do both, whatever, but I&#39;m not gonna be there this weekend and probably not next. <br /><br />I don&#39;t know exactly how many miles you all want to practice on, but if you&#39;re not up for a full Lawrence-KC ride, the stretch of old K-10 between Eudora and Lawrence is a good 6 or 7 miles of flat, straight, relatively decent pavement with a 55+ speed limit. You&#39;d have to get yourselves out to Eudora, though.
