				Yeah its an enigma, they all do that, but somehow, the carb may be the culprit, I know Rick can make a new intake that a diff carb can fit on, ask him about it

				every thing still tuns just fine,and i still have spark,as for the carb... spraying starter fluid down the intake should have some kind of result right?im getting nothing with or with out the carb hooked up.

				Starter fluid won&#39;t do much if the carb is full of crap... we have three of these in the group right now and they all turn out to revolve around the carb, some way some how...

				too much air for the starting fluid, would be my guess. You would just flood that engine outright.<br /><br />Put the carb on, take the spark plug out, spray starting fluid in there, reinsert to finger tight and try starting it.

				You can pull that brasstube that has the idle jet out with plyers, there is a 90 degree turn the fuel makes that easily becomes clogged and is near impossibly to change with out removing this pressed in brass tube.&nbsp; The tube can be reset using a little epoxy or something to hold it in place.&nbsp; If you clean the carb. without doing this it seems to always end up clogging again resulting in poor ideling and or not starting.
