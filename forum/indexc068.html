				I&#39;m pretty&nbsp; sure Tom had the guy at Klunk do it on his QT before he sold it to Ryan (the one that is blue now).&nbsp; Is that right or did you actually do that Ryan?

				yo, sunday it&#39;s on like szechuan. <br />do I need to pick up a &quot;spoke repair kit&quot; or something like it o wise one? or should I start straightening out wire hangers?<br /><br />maybe someone could chime in with some tire help for me too. I wanna get these hommies ORDERED!<br />&nbsp;<br />anyways...I need a 2.0-14 and a 2.25-14<br /><br />cheng shin makes the 2.25-14 no prob, and they&#39;re cheap/roadworthy<br /><br />the 2.0-14 had been harder to find. i found the schwalbe big apple here: http://www.amazon.com/Schwalbe-Apple-Tire-2-00-Black/dp/B000QSWBRG<br /><br />But that&#39;s the&nbsp; only 2.0-14 i can find. I;ve seen others on moped army runnin 2.25s on the front and back. sup with dat? are they too lazy too keep looking for the tire specified by the FSM or is there some ancient chinese secret that hasn&#39;t been revealed to me yet?<br /><br /><br />

				It is easier to order them as a pair. I&#39;m pretty sure they are the same on my qt. Tom bought the them at BIG&quot;O&quot;TIRES.<br /><br />Sunday around 12-12:30 at the shop. <br /><br />We should make a list off our numbers so everyone can contact eachother

				So I couldn&#39;t find my tires in stock ANYWHERE in como or the outlying areas. <br />But the guys at Columbia Powersports told me that they could order them for me. <br />So i went there today and they took real good care of me. Really. <br />They were nice (not ass kissing we&#39;ll do anything for a sale nice... like genuinely nice) and knowledgeable and didn&#39;t have any of that motorcycle shop attitude that I was expecting (you&#39;re riding a what?) <br />Got them ordered and they are gonna be SO SLICK LOOKIN!!! <br />Now I just gotta get my wheels (and the rest of the ped...paint job wisdom anyone?) worthy of carrying those tires. Kind of a backwards way to go about it...but however it gets done. <br />They were $25 a piece plus tubes. A bit more than the cheng shins but fuck it. <br />They&#39;ll be here tuesday. I also got some official yamaha high performance 2 cycle oil! SWEET!<br /><br />So...paint job wisdom anyone?

				oh yeah. Columbia power sports is a great place. They always ask me how fast my moped goes. When I rode my hobbit, the salesmen were all out looking at it. <br /><br />I paint. Will talk.

				columbia powersports...off rangeline, just north of 70. on vanwood. yeah bring that paint&nbsp; by...why not. I think I have my mind made up for what I want but I&#39;m always open to other ideas. What&#39;s this old motor parts store you speak of? <br /><br />god damn this shit is keepin me up at night. When I&#39;m laying in bed I get nonstop images of the QT all disassembled. I think about how good it&#39;s gonna look, and the perfect order of putting everything back on. And here I am gettin up an hour late for work.&nbsp;

				Moped Fever? There&#39;s got to be definition somewhere. I&#39;ve got it. Night after night it&#39;s moped this and that...I wake up and I&#39;m like &quot;are my parts here? When are we going to the shop? When&#39;s the next rally?&quot;. It&#39;s bad dudes. This website doesn&#39;t help me rein in my obsession in the least. At least I know it&#39;s not just me from midmopeds tweaking out. I&#39;ll be bartending later, so come by Booches&#39; tonight midmopeds and I&#39;ll buy you a pitcher of Mich. Lite.<br />TB
