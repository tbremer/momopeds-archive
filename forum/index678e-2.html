				Not safe if you ask me. I want to be able to hear what is going on around me. I want to, but I would rather have all my sense&#39;s focused on the road.<br />I also like to hear how my engine sounds too.<br />

				I used to ride to work listening to Jimmy Cliff&#39;s &quot;You Can Get it if You Really Want&quot; on The Harder They Come Soundtrack.&nbsp; It made my day, then my IPod shot craps and life sucks now.<br /><br />It really depends how loud you are rocking the music.

				Last time I downloaded an album I reaaaally wanted to listen to, I tried to listen to it while I rode to class. It was utterly pointless. If I turned it up enough that I could hear it over my engine, I couldn&#39;t hear anything else around me. In the end, I&#39;d rather just listen to my engine while I ride anyway. If you always do, you get a sense of what&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; and it&#39;s easier to know when something is sounding different and/or going wrong. Well, that, and I also like to be able to hear cars around me and stuff.

				i do the blaring music as loud as i can in one ear and listen to the world in the other ear trick. it works alright.<br /><br />when riding the batavus I would blare 3 inches of blood or something equally quick and heavy to make me feel like i am going faster. it worked.
