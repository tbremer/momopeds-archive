				I&#39;ve been dancing with the Harley since it has become my main ride to work, but recently came into a TNG Venice scooter that I keep making excuses to ride on errands. The Pinto still lacks a ZA flywheel but hope to come across one soon. -Bangers

I saw his CL post about vespa parts, but I just assumed he was getting rid of all his extra stuff. Did he sell his hobbit and all his grandes? I try to email him, but I never hear back. Maybe the Zuma and the Ninja are all he&#39;s interested in? <br /><br /><br />Or are we talking about Chris Lee?

				I have scooters, but their annoying ease of operation and habit of running pales when compared to the challenge of the obstinate moped.

				Rode the Harley down to the Dead End Rally in my old hometown of Peru,Ks. Ran into some trouble when I ran out of fuel at night, due to the local gas station having banker&#39;s hours. Luckily I was rescued when a couple of full patched guys and their ladies stopped to help. They had seen my bike at the rally and dug its old school style. Karl rode up to the station in Caney and came back with a gallon of go juice that my Ironhead liked so much, that she started on the first kick. I thanked them profusely and got on my way.
