				Okay, I told my boss I wanted off on Sunday, and since I came in tonight for him when I didn&#39;t have to, hopefully I&#39;ve got some leverage. Of course, I also stuck the hairball that&#39;s been stuck to the mop bucket for 9 months under the windshield wipers on his car (trust me, he deserved it), so.... <br /><br />If I&#39;m lucky, I&#39;ll know tomorrow if I&#39;ve got Sunday off. If I&#39;m not lucky, it might be Thursday or Friday before I actually see a schedule. Were we planning on riding afterwards?

				I looked at the weather... its gonna be 31 degrees. Maybe a fix it day would be better than a ride it day?<br /><br />It looks warm during this week and next, but since we had all those nice January weekends now we have to pay them back right?

				Weather report I&#39;m looking at says 41 for a high. That&#39;s still not that great, I guess, but it&#39;s better than 31. I&#39;d be down for whatever, though -- I just want to know if I should bring a moped or not.

				I work at Subway. I still haven&#39;t seen a schedule for this week yet (even though this week technically started yesterday), so I&#39;m still not 100% sure that I got Sunday off. I SHOULD have it off, but I don&#39;t want to guarantee that just yet. Assuming I&#39;ve got it off, though, I&#39;ll be at your place at 1:45.

				This probably doesn&#39;t matter, but I&#39;m probably just going to car it over from your place, Chuck. I left my moped out in the snowstorm last night, and I&#39;m betting that it won&#39;t run again until I prove that I still love it by bringing it inside and spending several hours cleaning it and waxing it and removing water from important crevices/parts.

				Meeting notes, for people who weren&#39;t there, weren&#39;t paying attention, have short-term memory loss, or whatever...<br /><br />For Missouri Loves Company:<br />1) Be at Chuck&#39;s house on March 20th at 5:45pm. We&#39;re leaving at 6:30, or sooner if we happen to be ready sooner.<br />2) We&#39;re taking my van, Chuck&#39;s van, Ed&#39;s car, and Kevin is going with Scott in his truck. I didn&#39;t really write down who all was coming or riding with whom. If anyone is dying to see a comprehensive list of exactly how many people and mopeds each car can take, and which people and mopeds are going in said cars, sorry, you&#39;re out of luck. You&#39;re welcome to work on that yourself, though. :)<br /><br />For our rally:<br />1) June 5-7<br />2) We&#39;re starting the ride at the Lava Room again (?)<br />3) .... we might have to talk some more about our rally<br /><br />Oh yeah, almost forgot -- Other rallies:<br />We&#39;re thinking what, Louisville/Whiskey Business (April 17-20) and Chicago/Bling BBQ (July 17-20)? Were those pretty much the only two summer-ish rallies? I didn&#39;t write anything down about this, so I&#39;m just kind of hoping that I remember what we said.
