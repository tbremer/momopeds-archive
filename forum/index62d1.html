			We&#39;re working on our website.&nbsp; So far we&#39;ve got this forum setup, and a group project blog.&nbsp; See the blog here: //mopedstl.com/blog/.<br /><br />The main site (//mopedstl.com) is under construction.&nbsp; Check back regularly to see our progress.

			Cool site I.R.E.&nbsp; I like it!&nbsp; You do amazing stuff Mike.&nbsp; <br /><br />Are you going to put an asterisk on the I.R.E lettering on the home page to tell people what it stands for?<br /><br />I just got the neighbor&#39;s Sachs Foxi running.&nbsp; It bogs badly.&nbsp; The air cleaner is missing and I found restricting the air intake makes it run much better.&nbsp; This must be one of those mopeds that needs the slight restriction of an air filter.&nbsp; Right now, I bolted a piece of metal half-way across the carb intake to make it run well.&nbsp; Where do I buy an air filter for a square Bing?&nbsp; Anyone?<br />Signed: Old F4rt.

			Oh yeah, I suppose we should say what I.R.E. means somewhere...&nbsp; I&#39;ll fix that when I get a minute to play with the site more.&nbsp; Like I said, this isn&#39;t at all what it will look like in the end.&nbsp; Me, Kristin, Tom, and Ryne kinda just threw this all together Thursday night.&nbsp; Eventually the site will be amazing (and not 5 different styles and such like it is now), but it&#39;ll be a little bit before then.<br /><br />I think I might actually have a square bing air cleaner laying around in my basement.&nbsp; Is it like a longish rectangular plastic box with a metal snap thing that keeps the end on?&nbsp; I have a square bing that is disassembled and I think complete, and I think that&#39;s the airfilter to it.&nbsp; I&#39;ll have to check.<br /><br />I think I still have that switch you wanted too...I think.
