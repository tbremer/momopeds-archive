				fuck it, i aint going up there. dude called me at 6 am and said he was standing in 2&quot; of water pulling up wet carpet and shoveling glass all night. not my specialty. he said he had to leave cause his back hurt. hmm. <br />&nbsp; and he told me to park 2 miles away in the airports cell phone lot when there&#39;s a big ass garage right next to where the work is. who the fuck makes this shit up? get some people in there to help then act like they&#39;re nobody just cause they&#39;re getting paid? im glad i got them details before i got in a big old suck ass hurry. don&#39;t get me wrong, im a good worker and have no problem bustin a move gettin the shit going, but this company&#39;s organization skills is something else. hey look at me im an idiot

				i envision the job as climbing up a rickety ass 6&#39; step ladder with a 4 x 8 sheet of plywood on my shoulder with 2 guys standing there talking about fishing watching me. <br />this company has been giving all the good work away to other contractors for the past 5 years, leaving me either sitting at home or doing this kind of shit work. -end rant- <br />i have a lead for next week anyway. :)

				Do most of you guys in StL have basements? They&#39;re pretty much par for the course around here, especially in newer homes, but I&#39;ve got no idea what it&#39;s like elsewhere in the country. KS has a reputation for having lots of tornadoes, but if I remember my coursework right, the mean center for tornado touchdowns in the last 50-ish years was somewhere in eastern or southeastern MO, or at the very least, it was a lot farther east than I expected.&nbsp;
