				We&#39;re having a mini fix it night over at my place starting around 6 or so I think.&nbsp; I need to get a hobbit running so Bangers can ride it.&nbsp; Well, it runs, it just doesn&#39;t idle.&nbsp; It shouldn&#39;t take too long.&nbsp; Ooh, maybe I can ride that instead of my craptastical maxi.&nbsp; Ryne is coming to fix his rear tire, and Alex might come coach me through hobbit carb work.&nbsp; I&#39;d say we&#39;ll be at the park when you want us there.&nbsp; What&#39;s your phone number so we can find you?<br /><br />Ted Drewes afterwards if it&#39;s not raining on us?

				Yeah its at Donaldsons, its called Car Cleaner Dip, usually one hour does it, you can let it sit overnite for sure dirty ass carbs, but its worked great for me over the years, I had forgot all about it until I saw a bottle at donaldsons on the rock road.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It cost $12 and you mix it with water, 1:2 and I know that sounds backwards, but yeah the water actuall helps somehow...Dave, any thoughts, Dave, earth to Dave...Dave if you can hear me blink one for yes...<br /><br />I have never taken out the gaskets, and your supposed to leave it all assembled and pur some of the CCD in the float bowl...then rinse, dry and fire it up!<br /><br />at any rate, looking forward to a ride, its been a hellova week!<br /><br />Jimmy
