				I got a running urban from Ryan K and brought it back to KC.&nbsp; I road it once before loaning it out to a guy while I was repairing his Minarelli.&nbsp; &nbsp;He brought it back broken and since then I have no idea why it won&#39;t start.&nbsp; &nbsp; It has strong spark, and I made sure it is still sparking when the plug is in the cylinder with my timing light.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, even with starting fluid I can&#39;t get it to fire or even pop.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thinking maybe the timing was wayyy off I did some research and it dosn&#39;t seem like that can even happen on Urbans.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#39;t really know what the problem might be and I have no experience messing around with urbans.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyone have any ideas?

				I got a plug last night and pried off the JB weld cap over the oil injector to find an quarter!&nbsp; &nbsp; Someone had put a quarter over the hole and then Jb welded it to the case.&nbsp; &nbsp;After I did that I&nbsp; checked the compression and it was around 45psi.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; &nbsp;I then took of the head and cylinder to look at the piston and rings and discovered that the guy I loaned it to had siezed it pretty bad on the exhaust side.&nbsp; He denies that it happened, but when I asked how he was mixing the oil / gas he basically told me that he was running 150: 1 with 50:1 oil..... facepalm.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />At this point I need a new cylinder and piston.&nbsp; Anyone have a stock nu50 top end?&nbsp; Rick? Scooter?
