				I found out that I needed a generator for my Harley and they are neither cheap nor easy to find. I did find one reasonably priced in the Bikers Choice catalog, but since they only sell through retailers, I had to find one willing to not jack up the price to bad. The local dealership wanted $300 and my local parts supplier had previously tried to get me to pay $48 for $3 worth of parts, which I took as a personal insult. So I tried Motor Care in Lawrence, Tim the guy that runs the place was not only friendly and helpful, he quoted&nbsp; me a price of $120. I was stoked and ordered it on the spot. He also sells some scooter stuff, I&#39;ll find out more when I go to pick up the parts.

				We call him &quot;Anderson Cooper&quot; because ... well, you know.<br /><br />He&#39;s cool for the most part, although I remember a memorable phone conversation with him where I asked if he had universal brake cables, he asked what I needed it for, I told him (1978 Puch Kromag), and he just laughed at me, &quot;Where do you think you&#39;re gonna find one of those?!&quot; I get that he does motorcycles and would probably rather not be bothered by little moped-riding punks though, and all around he&#39;s a pretty decent guy. If I ever had a motorcycle that I couldn&#39;t fix on my own, I&#39;d take it to him. If he ever doesn&#39;t have what you need, you should try the guy at the Motorcycle Shop across the street from Pizza Shuttle. He&#39;s cool too.

				mmhmm. AC keeps 17&quot; tubes stocked but he&#39;s kind of a prick. he really likes letting you know how easy moped tires should be to put on and what a fool you must be if you&#39;re coming in to buy another tube after effing up your first one.&nbsp; to his credit though, i think it has caused most of us to just save ourselves the trip and buy multiples while we&#39;re there--so maybe he&#39;s just a marketing genius.&nbsp; walt at the Lawrence Bike shop is rad as fuck though. AND he keeps motul stocked. and he loves our bikes so that&#39;s a definite bonus

				I just spent the day pulling the motor loose on my Sportster. Its necessary to pull the oil pump to check for a sheared woodruff key. What a PITA. Hopefully Tim gets the generator in tomorrow to keep me motivated.

				The visit with Tim was painless and he was a cool cat daddy. Its time to get everything back together and the gaskets from J &amp; P Cycles are still not here. Treats has spoiled me. I ordered on the 21st and they sent me notice that it shipped on the 25th.
