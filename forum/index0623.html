				Hello,<br /><br />&nbsp;Thanks, for all who showed, it means alot!<br /><br />Bikes break down, but we were there helping- and thats what its all&nbsp; about<br />Who goes fastest, who has the best bike...means nothing at all, if you just dont love riding...your a poser!<br /><br />How boring, yet zen like solo rides are, though...<br /><br />After everyone left, I rode around and have set a record lap time, maybe next time we;ll see if anyone can beat it. Ill buy Ted drews for anyone who can beat my 1:45 min! Ill even post it again for witnesees, all stock, so anyone with a pipe(alex) or a nice moded Puch or Franco ahould be able to beat my time..and get some ted drews...hell maybe Dave will quit bullshitting and show up next week and dominate us youngsters!<br /><br />By the way I had a out of body experince on the way home...I ran into 2 old friends, and well, it was surreal, had not seen them for 10 years...very strange...<br />there is a sea change a commin fellas&#39; you better fasten your chin straps!<br /><br />See you SUN!<br /><br />LAters<br /><br />-J.

				Definitely a success.&nbsp; Even though the group leaving Mark&#39;s was like...what, 45 minutes late?&nbsp; haha&nbsp; But we were there before Rick and Derrick, so we&#39;re not too bad.<br /><br />And I got my first seizing experience, which is actually good because I&#39;d always kind of worried a little bit about what would happen when you seize.&nbsp; It&#39;s not very exciting.&nbsp; It&#39;s like going full speed, then hitting the kill switch and coasting for a while, but with a big noise when your engine cuts out.&nbsp; But hey, my maxi made it through the whole ride.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t know there was another Ted Drewes.&nbsp; We had to stop there last night.&nbsp; So Tom, Alex, and I got treats.<br /><br />I can&#39;t wait for Sunday since Dave is helping me put my fancy new engine on.
