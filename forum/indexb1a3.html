				Tom had mentioned that no local rally this ear hinged on the fact&nbsp; that no one wanted to plan it.<br />I am willing to plan.&nbsp; What are important things to have or have planned?<br /><br />-I have several ideas for where to meet up, camp, sleep....<br />-I have some ideas for booze and food.-suggestions welcome<br />-Planning a route-suggestions for what to avoid?<br /><br />If you are interested in a St. Louis Rally this year or have suggestions please post.<br /><br />Barney also had an idea for a ride that would end or originate at Pinnacle Lake that would also be fun or be an alternative to the STL rally.&nbsp; It is between STL and COMO and has a lake and camping.&nbsp; Both STL and COMO could ride all the way there from there respective cities or we could meet there and plan a ride that begins and ends there.<br /><br />

				I could try to work in a free or reduced admission to whatever show Off Broadway has that night for anyone on a moped. Or if they don&#39;t have a show, we could try to plan one. Dates?

				For the record (and this applies to StL, CoMO, Holy Rollers, and anyone else) ...<br /><br />Rallies are expensive. I think we all know this by now. If you want to ask for money as part of the registration process, I am a-okay with that. $20 (or however much) is a more than reasonable price to pay for a place to camp and/or some grub and/or some cool rally pack shit while being entertained for a weekend by a bunch of moped nerds.

				i watched motorcycle diaries again the other night and I&#39;m all pumped for a long ride.i like the idea of a ride out hwy 94&nbsp; to&nbsp; herman area. I&#39;m thinkin weekday so there would be less wine traffic. im not holding my breath for a full blown stl/ire rally. seems like ire hit a wall&nbsp; somewere between loosing interest,loosing members , and not inviting new ones. it is what it is. midmos goin to be the rally in missouri this year. <br />Ryan i think a good plan is to let anyone on a moped get a reduced or free admission every night. or just weekends during the summer.<br />

				bryan even though riding down 94 would be a great idea but the only problem is the traffic even during the week and two is the blind curves and hills. its not only a death trap for motorcycles but i think it would be a death wish for peds.
