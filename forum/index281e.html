				Alright dudes,so I dropped the engine again,double checked everything,points are clean,carb&#39;s clean,just installed a new condensor,fuel seems to be flowing fine.Re-mounted the engine and got her running for a test ride,got her up to full speed,then I stopped,it died,and now won&#39;t turn over at all again,totally baffled here.

				No I don&#39;t think it seized,this is exactly what it did the first time,ran for a bit ok around the block then just wouldn&#39;t stay idling and wouldn&#39;t turn over again after it died which is initially why I thought it was a bad condensor,but that&#39;s been replaced and it&#39;s still doing the same thing.

				What&#39;s your plug looking like after it won&#39;t start?&nbsp; If it starts again and you take it for another spin and it does the same, pull that plug.&nbsp; It should help isolate the problem.&nbsp;

				The Grande fuel line seems to be prone to kinking due to the position of the petcock and the tight turns required in the line.<br /><br />Solution is to put an extra loop in the line.&nbsp; <br /><br />Alternatively... your piston might be ripped and your cylinder might be wrecked.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#39;ll try and drag my Grande over sunday and we can compare.&nbsp;

				Radical,looking forward to it.You&#39;re right about the odd petcock positioning but it still seems to be flowing ok ,when it does ride it feels ok,not like there would be a bad piston or cylinder,we shall see,i&#39;m ready for some answers!

				If you get it figured, please post.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have both my running grande and running bravo take a shit on me after a carb-bowl of fuel. Bravo failed on Saturday.&nbsp; Grande failed when I left for the Fixit.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t get any fuel back into the carb of either bike without letting it sit.&nbsp; I had to pedal home and couldn&#39;t find anything wrong.&nbsp; crazy stuff.&nbsp; Wonder if it could be some sort of carb-venting issue related to the hot weather?&nbsp;

				Did you check the filter on the petcock?&nbsp; I&#39;ve found isues there several times. Once the tube broke off and rust pluged it up.

				Good suggestion.&nbsp; I has considered that as well as cap venting or a clogged petcock - however if I pull the fuel line off the carb banjo, fuel starts pouring out.&nbsp; I figure it wouldn&#39;t be doing that it were a vacuum issue with the cap or the petcock screen being clogged.&nbsp; <br /><br />Whatever is going on it seems related to the float valve.&nbsp; But both bikes have very nice clean needle valves and floats - they operate just fine when I have the carbs off the bikes.&nbsp; That vent tube at the top of the throttle tower seems to be open as well...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
