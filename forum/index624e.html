				Daryl, if my GPS mount fits on the MB5, you can use that. I may even try and plug a route into it so you can get there without taking main roads.<br /><br />Or you can follow me, whatevs. Hit me up later today and we&#39;ll figure it out. I need to grab that frame from you anyway.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Ride was baller. We had a great turnout (especially thanks to Brett&#39;s non-moped friends), nobody broke down, we all stayed together pretty well, we ate a crapload of hot dogs, and we watched fireworks. Good times for sure.
