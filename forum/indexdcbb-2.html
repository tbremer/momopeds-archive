				Mike, have you ran this on your Maxi aswell?<br /><br />I wanna know how it preforms on a stock 50cc.<br /><br />I was looking at this pipe and the Proma Circuit for the build I am doing now, but don&#39;t want to buy two, &#39;cause I am broke ass mofo.<br /><br />The MA Wiki says it&#39;s great for 50cc.

				Yeah, I ran it on my maxi with a 15mm bing, and I opened up the exhaust port to match the header on the pipe.&nbsp; It ran great until the za50 decided to start slowly killing itself.&nbsp; I&#39;d say it&#39;d do well on stock, and any of the smaller kits.&nbsp; You won&#39;t want it for any 80cc chaos though.

				I know it fits on a stock maxi cylinder, flange-wise.&nbsp; The header is pretty big.&nbsp; I had to open up the exhaust port just about as big as it would get at the mouth to match it.&nbsp; No idea on exact measurements though.

				If you could, would you measure it in milimeters for me? I just need to know the port size and the distance between the flage bolt holes center to center. I think I can make it work if the bolt holes are the correct distance apart. Errr I Engineer somshit.

				Well, the Boss is on my magnum, which is my main form of transportation right now.&nbsp; I could measure the outside, but taking it off isn&#39;t in the plans as I&#39;ve got other things to do to it (getting my PHBG tuned, mainly).<br /><br />Tom, gimme monies and I can order you one.&nbsp; You want to pay the extra $5 for black?&nbsp; haha
