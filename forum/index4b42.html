				Wanted to let the IRE know that Oscar who was our oldest member of the O&#39;Fallon Holy Roller Moped group passed away yesterday (Oct 31st) from cancer. (Oscar was the elderly gentleman who came to the Fort last fall wearing bib overalls)&nbsp; His wife wanted you all to know how much she and the family really appreciated you all welcoming Oscar to the Fort and showing him around your shop last fall during the IRE and HR BBQ.&nbsp; She said it was one of the highlights of his year to meet you all and see what you were doing with mopeds. <br /><br />Thank you all for showing him such kindness and reaching out to him and showing him a great day last year!&nbsp; &nbsp;
