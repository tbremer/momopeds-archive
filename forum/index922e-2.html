				&nbsp;OK, i have me a vespa and i have been saving and I&#39;m going to buy a new case either a Malossi reed or Polini speed, I&#39;ve even seen some used/new 90cc on MA but they already cut on them so that scares me, I don&#39;t like the idea of 2ND hand mistakes anyway, I will make that choice my question is in this heat running at a higher then stock RPM will this heat 100 degrees raise the risk of a seize to where its dangerous to ride on a high reeving kit? Or as long as I have the fan and plastics fanning the venting system properly it should be fine??? So this question is for people who have ridden in hot ass weather at high RPM&#39;s before on a kitted vespa or similar bike. <br /><br />&nbsp;Any advice on vespa cases would be appreseated.

				I&#39;ve ridden in hot ass weather at high RPM&#39;s. I rode my MK80 60 miles round trip (PLUS the actual ride) to Kansas City almost every weekend last summer. If you set your bike up right you won&#39;t have problems. For any given tuning state you will probably experience more heat fade than you would on a cooler day, all other things being equal. You can correct this through various piston modifications, running a little more rich on oil (and rejetting appropriately), pulling timing back, etc. Or just don&#39;t go WOT forever. You&#39;ve got the advantage of having a fan, so you will have more cooling air at all speeds than you would for a ambient-air cooled engine. I&#39;ve got a Zuma (variated, fan cooled, high-rpm) that runs exactly the same - hot day or cold day. It&#39;s all in the setup; I&#39;d say you&#39;re more likely to seize due to being inexperienced at tuning (I don&#39;t mean that to be derogatory) or any other number of problems than you would just because it&#39;s hot out.

				The high heat has raised my cruising temps 20 degrees or better but its only really dangerous in heavy traffic where there isn&#39;t any air movement to help cool it down.
