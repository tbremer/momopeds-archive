				&nbsp;I wonder if he was using a stabilizer bar. I would love to talk to someone who has rocked that motor just to get their opinion. Bemji says it pushes up to 16hp. I dont know if i could ever throw down that much cash at once, but im very curious due to the hype.. <br />

				I&#39;ve got a grande speedo cable and a bad speedo... kinda silly trade though.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think I have two halves of a grande speedo cable from the product of an ill-advised disassembly.&nbsp; Seems the guy who sold me my project super deluxe bravo planned to sell it part-by-part, so I bought a headlight assembly with cut wiring and a cut-off cable inside.&nbsp; Then he sold me the rest and I have the other had of the cable.&nbsp; That kind of stuff breaks my heart knowing how hard it is to find such parts and what a pain it is to splice a wiring harness back together...<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if a cut cable that would help you much, I&#39;d have to search a bit to track it down...&nbsp;

				Aw, that&#39;s OK Jack. . . probably can&#39;t use the cut one, &#39;cuz when I put a new inner cable into it,the place where the two sheath pieces are joined back together will eat up the inner in no time at all.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know why some folks tear up half of the good shit when they part out a bike, but I&#39;ve seen that many times before.&nbsp; I had a dumb uncle who had an auto junkyard - he would take his tractor and roll a car over (smashing the roof, doors, fenders, glass, etc.) in order to remove a $10 muffler.&nbsp; He didn&#39;t last too long in that business.<br /><br />Smiff

				If your need is great, I do have a good cable.&nbsp; and it&#39;s hooked up to a bad speedo anyway, so I could let it go w/o too many tears...&nbsp; Isn&#39;t doing me a whole lot of good.&nbsp; Both my Grandes are&nbsp; projects anyway.&nbsp; Basic, mod bike and a planned complete restoration signal bike.&nbsp; Neither is gonna be my roller any time soon.&nbsp; I&#39;m expecting to get my signal-bravo and my wife&#39;s catsup Ciao going before I get either Grande functional.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yeah, man, I&#39;ll take that cable . . . and send you a good speedo for it, if you&nbsp; don&#39;t have a good one for either Grande.&nbsp; I assume you have two good cables, and no speedo while I have two good speedos and no cable.&nbsp; (actually I have 3 speedos, but the third one has most of the pointer broken off . . . the &quot;stubby pencil&quot; syndrome).<br /><br />Let&#39;s exchange addresses via PM.

				Hmmm, I got the Grande from IRE Mark back about the time spring had just sprung...maybe April or so.&nbsp; It&#39;s the el cheapo, straight drive, no variator.

				there was a day,,, eugene,,, and 2 more red frame have been found since,,, your&#39;s is the closest in the pict before the headlight changed back,,, all grande&#39;s as far as I know, are variated , although I&#39;ve thought to build a unvariated version as a test. and I wonder, would someone really variate that $1300,&nbsp; 12,000 rpm outfit on treats?

				&nbsp;In my opinion a variater would be one of many weak links that could break with the extra rpm, torque, and hp etc. I believe it was Mike Pee who said that motor broke a ciao in half. A person will need to reinforce and upgrade every part of a ped to make it realistic to ride with that power. Potentially 16hp!!! Wow!

				yeah you need to reinforce everything to use that engine. The frame, especially where the tank meets the swingarm all the way down to the roller bearings in the rear hub. And you gotta use the polini variator. And a scooter clutch if yer thinkin.
