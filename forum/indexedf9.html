				Luckily I did here you coming down the street today before you honked your moped horn. Not sure why you honked but either way, I thought I would offer up a little advice.<br />PLEASE buy a helmet! It may just be your means of survival.<br />Please ride your stock moped in the lane of traffic, you are to be treated as if you are a motocycle not a bicycle.<br />Please learn and use hand signals, despite the fact that you have turn signals, that I don&#39;t remember seeing light up they are a helpful tool to others on the road.<br />Please stay off the big roads like Hampton (for which you turned onto off of Eichelberger). For your stock ped you are a&nbsp; dangerous hazzard on the big road without having multiple other riders riding with you. and the fact that you were veering between the lane and the parking lane.<br /><br />Now, that said I&#39;m no expert rider, but&nbsp; and I don&#39;t ride that often any longer but when I do, these are ALL things I choose to do for both my safety and the safety of others.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t know who you are you were as follows: red moped with rear blinker lights and square/rectangular headlight, long hair and ball cap, with black bag strapped on the back of the bike.

				Besides the safety aspect, it&#39;s just too cold to ride without a helmet.

				I saw the dude yesterday. Yelled to him that he needed to get a helmet. I think he was more concerned about staying warm though.
