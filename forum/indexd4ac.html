			<strong>JSTarga</strong>:
			<br />
			Just bought this Targa (95 I believe) and its having trouble starting, allegedly the carbs had been cleaned and its got new fuel lines. Was told in order to start clean you had to put the choke down, kickstart it, give it full throttle for a second while the choke&#039;s on, then pull the choke back up but when I do these steps it dies as soon as I give it throttle.I&#039;ve used a couple new plugs because they get fouled with oil with too many non-starts but it doesn&#039;t seem to be working...
