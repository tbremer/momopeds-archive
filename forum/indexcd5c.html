				So, my roomate and I are parting ways at the end of March, I won&#39;t be able to afford the Batavus.<br /><br />If you want to hold on to it or want some downpayment or something I am willing to do that, but my lease is getting killed at the end of March so affording it in time for you to bring it down for the rally won&#39;t happen.<br /><br />If you sell it, no big deal either. Someone is always getting rid of a Batavus.<br /><br />If you just want it out of your basement I can hold on to it and pay-pal you money as it comes in, or find a buyer for it.<br /><br />Let me know,<br />Sorry!

				If I remember correctly the green frame is just a frame, which might be a cool build, but I know paul wanted to do that.. he said he just doesnt have money. The other Maxi is Andy&#39;s and I thought he was gonna sell it to Andrew.. dont know though.<br /><br />

				yeah the green one is pretty sparse these days, the red one (as of Sunday) is now missing the front wheel, and i understand it has been sold.<br />I have an E-50 crank case that could go to the green one, but it has almost nothing else. <br />

				Lime green is cool. If Paul doesnt buy it, I&#39;d like to bring it back from the dead. I&#39;m probably getting rid of that pinto I bought. It probably needs just as much work. But that green color... I think I&#39;d even tear a ped apart to paint it that color. Its awsome.
