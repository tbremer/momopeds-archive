				I found an article about motorcycle carburetor tuning and I would like us to put our heads together and see if we can apply the information to simpler moped carburetors.&nbsp; I will first give you a link of where the article is, so you can read it yourself.&nbsp; Then, I want to summarize key points that I&#39;m hoping we can apply to moped carburetors that do not have all the adjustments a motorcycle carburetor has.&nbsp; The article is at:<br />https://www.johnsmotorcycleparts.com/Keihin_CV_tuning_tips.htm<br /><br />What interests me from the article is the idea we should do multiple plug chops to see where our carburetor problem is.&nbsp; AND we should always use NEW sparkplugs.&nbsp; The article says motorcycle carburetors have 1.) idle circuits 2.) midrange circuits and 3.) high speed circuits.&nbsp; I know most of our moped carburetors have the midrange and high circuits, but I have not figured out the idle circuits form mine yet.<br /><br />The midrange circuit is the needle attached to the throttle slide.&nbsp; The size, shape and position (up and down) of the needle gives us proper medium speed cruising.&nbsp; The main jet controls fuel flow at wide open throttle (WOT).<br /><br />The article tells us to do a plug chop by putting in a new plug, run the motorcycle at the range (right now, I&#39;ll say medium speed or WOT) and kill the engine and inspect the plug.&nbsp; The article explains that we will no longer see the tan color we all see in the books about mopeds.&nbsp; Leaded gasoline gave that tan color, and we don&#39;t have lead in the gasoline any more.&nbsp; NOW WE NEED EGGSHELL WHITE!&nbsp; We look at the ceramic surface below the spark gap and nothing else.&nbsp; So, for example, we would put in a new plug, run the moped for a mile or two at mid-throttle, kill the engine and inspect the plug.&nbsp; Then, we would find an open area, PUT IN A NEW PLUG and run the moped at WOT for a mile or two.&nbsp; Again, we would kill the engine and do an inspection of the plug color.<br /><br />Then, we need to figure out what our carburetor &quot;idle circuit&quot; is and do a third plug chop (with another new plug) with the engine idling.&nbsp; Actually, the article implies this is the first plug chop, but you get the idea.<br /><br />Interesting stuff!&nbsp; Can we apply it to mopeds?<br /><br />Dave

				I think we can totally apply this, especially the WOT and Midrange. If we all had fancy carbs like mike and alex we woukd be able to test all three. Crazy PHBG carbs.<br /><br />However, for me, Bingo, and Mark (rex) we dont have needles in our carbs... What to do about that?
