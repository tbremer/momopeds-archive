				Jared was so kind as to give away an old Cub 50 (or super cub, or something 50) that he bought years back and didn&#39;t fix up.&nbsp; Alls I wanted was a frame to start with, and so RK and I stripped the bike down and had our way with it!&nbsp; &nbsp;I seem to have a lot of parts for the honda 50s from back in my days of pit bikes, so I started collecting them together in anticipation of the build.&nbsp; For the most part it will be a bolt and build bike! <br /><br />The plans for the bike will be daily driver and back up bike at rallies.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will probably have a wheelset with dual sports for going to the farm, I will be lacing my own wheels anyway so why not make an extra set?<br /><br /><br />Pics of what i have done later, it is all at work now.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Pic now to make me wish I needed a chopper instead of a comfy bike:<br /><br />(//2.bp.blogspot.com/-jwopv7HgEOQ/TxCS9XQ0VwI/AAAAAAAAGPI/Rq1JMbmPYj4/s1600/authentic_motor_service_cub.jpg)

				yeah, pit bike frame style! warning, big pic<br /><br />//2.bp.blogspot.com/--ubbffe6nuc/TwrJKShFVjI/AAAAAAAAGNY/XFGBDRFVXMI/s1600/garage521_solo2.jpg<br /><br /><br />Probably what mine will look like, I already bought new plastics and front fender to make it classy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Funny thing is my wife fell in love with the cub a few days after I started the project, although I hadn&#39;t told her. <br /><br />(//www.vaiden.net/the_honda_50_2.jpg)

				The old bike didn&#39;t look so hot.&nbsp; I forgot to take pics of it, but if you have seen a rusty honda 50 you have seen them all.&nbsp; Both wheels were seized.&nbsp; The gas tank wasn&#39;t so rusty though!&nbsp; &nbsp; Original engine seems to have compression, but I don&#39;t need it.&nbsp; All I want is the svelt looking frame!<br /><br />So now we can start the &quot;hardly anything bought&quot; build.&nbsp; I seriously had everything laying around!<br /><br /><br /><br />Some sad panda wheels...<br /><br />(//www.holmeshobbies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMAG0411.jpg)<br /><br /><br /><br />Poor pile of parts, who is going to look after you?<br /><br />(//www.holmeshobbies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMAG0410.jpg)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This is what happens to pit bike wheels in my house!&nbsp; Hiyaaa!<br /><br />(//www.holmeshobbies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMAG0409.jpg)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ok, so I didn&#39;t totally karate chop the hub into submission.&nbsp; I did relace it into a 17&quot; rim I had laying around.&nbsp; &nbsp;Huzza for reusing parts!<br /><br />(//www.holmeshobbies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMAG0412.jpg)<br /><br /><br /><br />Looking there, the pit bike hub works with the stock rear end!&nbsp; Add a little magic dust for the disc brake and we are in action!<br />(//www.holmeshobbies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMAG0415.jpg)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lets just bolt up these pit bike shocks and see what happens.&nbsp; Lookie there, same headset and everything!&nbsp; I may have to thin the headtube, but that is hardly trouble.<br />(//www.holmeshobbies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMAG0414.jpg)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I don&#39;t think she looks too bad so far!&nbsp; I will relace the front hub into a 17&quot; rim in time, but that will require redoing the shocks so my steering geometry doesn&#39;t get screwed up.<br /><br />(//www.holmeshobbies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMAG0416.jpg)<br />
