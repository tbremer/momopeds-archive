			<dd class="postbody">
				I have been having the lousiest luck finding a speedo drive (the thingy on the front wheel) and cable for my Grande.&nbsp; First I get a drive that needs the cable to screw inside it, but the cable has a cap that screws onto the outside of the drive.&nbsp; So I traded it for a cable and drive that match up, but didn&#39;t notice that it has a skinny (1 1/2 mm) cable that wouldn&#39;t run my speedo cuz it needs the fat (2 1/2 mm) cable.<br /><br />If it wasn&#39;t for bad luck I wouldn&#39;t have any luck at all, cuz I swapped the skinny cable/drive off for a fat cable/drive.&nbsp; I put it on the Grande and . . . the fucker turns the wrong way!!!!<br /><br />I got 3 speedos, all needing a cable that turns clockwise.&nbsp; Gladly swap a good clockwise speedo and the counterclockwise turning cable/drive for a fat clockwise turning Grande cable/drive unit.<br /><br />:( Smiff<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; Or, I&#39;ll buy it if you don&#39;t need the speedo &amp; cable swap

				Still no luck on finding a speedo cable &amp; drive unit (the thingy on the wheel hub) for my Grande.&nbsp; I will pay liberally (and even toss in a 12-pack of PBR!!) to the first person who comes up with the right set-up.<br /><br />The cable needs to be the fat (2 1/2 mm) one that turns clockwise - the same direction as the way the speedo needle turns when you are riding.&nbsp; HELP!!<br /><br />PS, if you need one, I will even throw in a Grande speedo!!

				When you hold it in your right hand with the tab (that turns with the wheel) sticking out towards the left and turn it in the same manner the wheel would turn it, look down in the hole where the cable plugs in and see which direction the square cable socket turns.&nbsp; If it is turning clockwise, then it is the correct drive thingy.<br /><br />If you can&#39;t see down in the dark hole to tell which way it is turning then try this:<br /><br />Hold it in front of you with the part where the cable is inserted pointing upwards and the side that would face the brake drum pointed away from you, then<br /><br />if it looks like this -----&gt; d&nbsp; it will turn counter-clockwise and is the wrong one<br /><br />if it looks like this -----&gt; b&nbsp; it will turn clockwise and is the correct one!! :)<br /><br />Smiff

				Yes, it would be weird for the cable to turn the wrong way.&nbsp; The the driver I have is made to be mounted on the left side of the front wheel, so if it is put on the right side it will run backwards.&nbsp; The normal place for the Grande speedo drive is on the right side so I need a driver made for that side.&nbsp; I think the one I have was off a Ciao, at least some models (if not all) which had the speedo drive on the left side.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if turning the front wheel around would work, since the forks might interfere with the brake lever (it being in the trailing position rather than forward), the brake shoes operating backwards, etc.&nbsp; Even though all sorts of &quot;different&quot; things are regularly done to modify our mopeds, methinks just putting the correct speedo drive on it would be the simplest solution.&nbsp; That is one shaped like a &quot;b&quot; rather than a &quot;d&quot;.<br /><br />Smiff&nbsp;

				think i found it. i&#39;m not %1000 sure cause i have a couple of speedo setups and i thought I had the vespa drive and cable attached and my other set were unattached, but i think I had it backwards...<br /><br />that probably doesn&#39;t make any sense, but so you want me to ship it to you to try it out? I don&#39;t have a vespa speedo, so i can&#39;t test it.<br /><br />oh yeah...is the vespa setup a Veglia or a CEV? silly me. that&#39;s the difference.

				I hope it will take the standard size inner cable.&nbsp; I had found one that turned the right way, but it required the small (about 1.5 mm) size cable rather than the normal (2.6 mm) cable.<br /><br />The speedometer is a Veglia.<br /><br />Smiff

				Thanks for the offer, but the Ciao speedo drive is on the left side of the wheel whereas the Grande is on the right . . . if you put a Ciao drive on a Grande (like I have at present) it is turned around and the wheel then drives it backward (counter-clockwise).<br /><br />Smiff

				OK I found a cable and a drive,,,that don&#39;t go together apparently. I must have the right combo around here somewhere. YOu want these? I know they&#39;re both for vespa, and maybe the combo with you other stuff might work eventually. I&#39;m pretty sure the drive is the &quot;b&quot; one your talkin about. I need to run to storage again soon. i&#39;ll take another look for the cable when i&#39;m there.<br /><br />(http://i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee277/johngilbreth/mostly%20vespa%20moped%20garage%20sale/Photo171.jpg)

				Yep, that&#39;s a &quot;b&quot; shaped speedo drive.&nbsp; All I need is a cable with the screw-on cap to fit those threads on that drive.&nbsp; &nbsp;The &quot;d&quot; type Ciao drive that I have has no metal screw-on cap, instead the cable sheath screws down inside the drive.<br /><br />I&#39;ll send you the Ciao drive and cable since I have no need for it . . . you might use it if you have a Ciao, or it can be swapping material.
