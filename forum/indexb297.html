				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#39;d like to call for a brief moratorium on anyone riding the express, at least until we get it fixed up.&nbsp; We put a brand new cylinder on it, and I know its being ridden around without an air filter.&nbsp; This is what destroyed the first cylinder.<br /><br />Plus, Mike drained the tank, and there was straight gas in it.&nbsp; It needs premix cause we disabled the oil injector.<br /><br />I know it needs to be gone, and I know it&#39;s fun to ride around the block, but I need it to be in running order when we try to sell it.&nbsp; I&#39;ll try to come over this week and get it together and out of the shop.<br /><br />&lt;3 you<br />Annie

				oops , I&#39;m sorry,, I went over and poured a quart fo rubbing alchol in the tank and took it for a little ride,, figured it&#39;d clean it out,,, just as the tears were streaming thru my crows feet, it made a funny noise,, made the rear tire skid, and I had to walk it back carrying the back wheel off the ground home,,, I hit it with a hammer a couple of times, and it wouldn;t come undone,, probaby,, too hot still&lt; I&#39;ll try again tommorrow,, that aint got oil in it,,? where its leaking at now ,,huh?
