				It was a blast. We got there at lIke245 in the am and found everyone at nachbar. Drank our assEs off and found our campsite. A little longer ride would suite me.campsite was awsome. Drug dogs not. I&#39;m not sure the were very good dogs.&nbsp; Other than the stl rally this year best ever&nbsp;
