				The Sunday Fix It was fun, we had two new guys turn up for the ride after, chased another one down on the ride, and my Maxi-N got a little closer to reliable. The food was delicious and I would have stayed until midnight but I hadn&#39;t been home since Thursday and so had to bow out.&nbsp; Looking forward to Tuesday Ridenight! -Bangers

				Alright. I&#39;ll probably get there like noonish. If anyone needs a loaner (Justin?), the Tomos is still in my car from last weekend, and I&#39;m too lazy to go take it out right now, so it&#39;ll be coming with me.

				It was fully awesome, even though I had to ride a Honda.<br /><br />Justin&#39;s theme of the night: &quot;HEY Let&#39;s go ride!&quot;<br /><br /><br />Head light stuff... You mean like HEAD LIGHT STICKERS?! That&#39;d be awesome. I had a Call of Duty-style grenade logo on my sealed beam lamp.. Then it burned out, so I had to switch lamps. Now I&#39;m headlight decal-less. We should have one.<br /><br />Um. Members only?

				I&#39;d go with you to get rags and paint, but I&#39;d probably try to combine that with a ride day, so it wouldn&#39;t be till Sunday or Tuesday or something. If you wanna go before then, that&#39;s cool too. <br /><br />On the Vitamin water, I&#39;d say get as many as you can. I never cease to be amazed by how many people will pay over $2 for a bottle of that stuff at Subway, so I guess it&#39;s pretty popular. <br />

				What are you doing about registration for the rally, I have quite a few friends who will be wanting to ride on Saturday. I&#39;d say on the order of 10-12 people if that helps at all.

				i might go on tuesday it only takes an our to paint the rags so any time before would be okay.&nbsp; I work till friday so whenever is cool with me.&nbsp; Should we charge for the vitamin water?&nbsp; Like .50 or a dollar? to make up the cost of food? We can get a huge tub of ice (i can get the ice from my old job...they owe me:) We could get some water to...lets figure it out on sunday.&nbsp; i have my note book with all the little details.&nbsp; I am sure I can get my buddy to cook for us.&nbsp; Not sure I have a phone call in.&nbsp; We will figure it out.&nbsp; Hey Linda and Justin you guys want to go on another long ride Tuesday?&nbsp; We can hit up a few more places that will hang up our flyer!&nbsp;

				Yeah, I should be able to do Tuesday if you wanna wait &#39;till then. <br /><br />If you can get enough vitamin waters, maybe give everyone one free, then charge for whatever&#39;s left? <br /><br />If we could get someone to cook, that would make it a lot easier on us. I&#39;m still down to make a shit ton of cookies, though. <br /><br />I&#39;m totally down for more riding on Tuesday. Should we try to work on buttons or rag spraying too? <br /><br />Kevin, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve got any registration plans. We could do one of those google form thingies, but people might not see it and then we&#39;d have more people coming than people that registered. I dunno, Chuck, would it be helpful to know how many people were planning on coming, or should we just stick with our estimates?
