			well stock puchs are 45t on the rear, and it depends on what HP your bike was rated at weather or not it has a smaller or larger sprocket up front.&nbsp; If you are only looking for 35mph i&#039;d suggest a proma circuit pipe... they are loud as hell but there are work arounds (different baffles) that you can use to quiet them down.<br /><br />a beefy header will just slow you down on a stock cylinder.&nbsp; the proma header is maybe 2mm larger ID than stock which will be plenty on a stock cylinder.<br /><br />as far as jetting goes I don&#039;t know what to tell you because i&#039;ve never used a bing before.<br /><br />what clutch? timing?

			which cylinder? i was messing around with a 1 hp yesterday at the shop. it had a 14mm intake derestricted, 52 jet in a 14mm carb, original stock airbox and 13 x 45. bike ripped up to 22 mph but wouldnt go faster.&nbsp; i really dig 16 x 45 with a stock setup for decent low end but still going mid 30s to get you down the road. also tune your clutch.
