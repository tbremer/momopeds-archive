			<strong>JCalton</strong>:

			I put it on Craigslist for about 10 days and never got contacted, so http://www.ebay.com/itm/261576811693<br /><br />I know this is pricey, but it&#039;s basically the world&#039;s biggest noped.<br />If anybody in the forums buys it, I&#039;ll give &#039;em 10% off whatever the final bid is (maybe more if you&#039;re in MMP). I think I&#039;m in it for about $1200 but that is a guess.<br /><br />I am *not* fishing for bidders here, just letting you know it&#039;s there in case it interests someone into two-strokes that also wants a big bike.<br /><br />It&#039;s fun as hell and really easy to shift. You can easily do all the shifts except 1st &lt;--&gt; 2nd without the clutch.<br />But it IS a two-stroke so it needs tuning and your periodic attention. The period depends on how good you are at wrenching.<br /><br />I love the bike, but I&#039;m cheating and trying to get a new low-maintenance four-stroke single, and I need the cash. Emphasis on cash, this is not available on layaway.&nbsp; :)
