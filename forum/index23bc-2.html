				The stroke is slightly off from a batavus to a Puch.&nbsp; Tom investigated this possibility, and if I remember what he said, you need to press a puch conrod into the batavus crank to make it work.<br /><br />So, you need this, and a machine shop:<br />http://www.treatland.tv/puch-moped-con-rod-kit-crankshaft-p/puch-crankshaft-con-rod-kit.htm (http://www.treatland.tv/puch-moped-con-rod-kit-crankshaft-p/puch-crankshaft-con-rod-kit.htm)<br /><br />Also, the kit is slightly cheaper from treats:<br />http://www.treatland.tv/puch-moped-65cc-metrakit-cylinder-kit-p/puch-metrakit-65cc-cylinder.htm (http://www.treatland.tv/puch-moped-65cc-metrakit-cylinder-kit-p/puch-metrakit-65cc-cylinder.htm)<br /><br />I&#39;ve used this kit on a puch for over a year and can vouch for it&#39;s greatness.&nbsp; Power and reliability, which is a rare combo with kitted bikes.&nbsp; Pair it with a 19mm phbg carb and a pipe of your choice (I prefer the techno boss), and you&#39;ve got a solid bike.<br /><br />Batavus with this is all experimental though.&nbsp; Do it!

				clips? well that&#39;s a 70cc on an Laura m56 I think it would work, maybe it would run good with some port remaping. <br /><br /><strong>BUT..</strong> All the bat clutches that I am aware of are junk, they just can&#39;t take the power.<br /><br />it is (unfortunately) a waste of time (and money).<br /><br />on a lighter note with some custom brackets a motobecane, or Peugeot engine could be bolted up to the starflight (belt drive with big ass pulley) series.<br /><br />I think this one (in above picture) would take pretty well to an E50, or za.

				the m56 and m48 are significantly different motors. I assumed you were talking about the m48. I know nothing of that Trac motor though, it might work...

				o yeah I forgot about that, is it &quot;Dailem&quot; (DLM)? I got a trac (dlm) 2 speed auto downstairs.<br />the bitch I sold it to put gas from a regular 4 stroke mower in there, and welded up the jug.<br /><br />then she tried to tell us it was our fault! that bike went 40 on 50cc, what a bitch.<br />

				So maybe a smaller kit might work? when i bought this batavus its exhaust flange was broken (and missing so re welding isnt an option without new flange) Unless i can weld the exhaust directly to the cylinder????? and its rings need to be replaced also the piston looks slightly worn, the cylinder walls look very clean... also anyone know size of piston rings???

				you lost me at &quot;weld the exhaust directly to the cylinder&quot;, with this statement I now doubt you have the experience to determin the actual condition of the engine.<br /><br />side note: the clutch on the Laura M48 can&#39;t Take the power of the engine at a stock level.<br />I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s what you are running

				it was kind of a half joke, i kinda knew i couldn&#39;t weld it to the cylinder case...&nbsp; and no i dont have any experience with mopeds :-) im sorry i wasn&#39;t more specific with the motor type its the laura m56, i am mechanically inclined ( i can take things apart and put them back together the same way they came apart and they still work and am a 12volt technician) but this is my first bike and i am trying to learn as much about it as i can..... i have the same bike in your picture thats the regency right?

				I&#39;ve never seen a bat in midtown...maybe its b/c its a bat...do those things actually work? lol.<br /><br />Leo has some m56 bat parts. The motor on the 56 looks quite sturdy and with some case inforcement and drilling the intake could become quite large. But I&#39;m still not sure the crank could handle any sort of power.<br /><br />Good luck with your project.
