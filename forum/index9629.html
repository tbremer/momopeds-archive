				Here is a pic of the bike.&nbsp; It might look like it&#39;s being worked on but I have done hardly anything with it since I got it a year ago.&nbsp; Chrome looks good but some rust on the engine and exhaust that can probably be sanded off.&nbsp; I put a new battery in it when I got it as well as a new key cylinder and the dashboard lit up.&nbsp; The transmission shifts cleanly and would indicate neutral on the dash as well.&nbsp; The bike is relatively complete from what I can tell including a nifty backup tank that looks like a canteen and straps to the side. When I got the bike it turned over fine.&nbsp; I got as far as being able to get a test light to flicker at the spark plug boot but I could never get a spark at the plug.&nbsp; This was probably last April.&nbsp; The bike sat until November and when I tried to kick it, it was frozen up.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t touched it since.&nbsp; It didn&#39;t seize while running so it shouldn&#39;t be too bad.&nbsp; If someone is actually interested in it though, I&#39;ll just go ahead and try to take the cylinder off so I can give an idea what&#39;s going on.&nbsp; Maybe a jammed up kickstart too, I haven&#39;t checked it out...<br />It could definitely be delivered when we are up for the rally<br /><br />Ben
