				I will be up by 8:00 if you guys get in early. Bring some disc golf discs, we could play quail ridge after the holy roll. Or if you want to get silly we could go to the closed down golf course and rip it up and maybe go for a swim in the lake. I will buy some meat for the grill if peoples wants to party.
