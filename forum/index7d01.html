				Hello all,<br />Name&#39;s shaun. I have been looking for a local moped/scooter forum for some time and a good friend of mine told me about your forum...and Im liking it! (thanks Dougie)<br /><br />I have had a few mopeds in my day, but now im rocking a scooter due to the upgrade parts available for them. Im posting this cause I dont know how you guys feel about cruising around town with people on scooters?<br /><br />I have been a Mechanic for about 10 years now and do all my own wrenching and have a vast ammount of tools to get the job done, if that makes anyone feel better=). <br /><br />thanks !<br />

				Oh.. one more thing. I can help anyone on here with scooter related problems/questions if they have any... I have learned a good deal on how to mod/fix these things so hit me up if you have any questions. <br /><br />I am currently working on a 2006 Roketa 50... its got a 139qmb 4 stroke on it. We have added 72cc bigbore kit, perf. cam, exhaust mod, variator mod, 1,500 rpm clutches and some other goodies... it will be on the street soon =)<br />

				I like Scooters but not may in the crew ride &#39;em. (might just be me). It&#39;s a Vento Triton R4. It is rocking stock cruises at 45 easy. Love it. Flirted with variator mods and performance exhaust but just don&#39;t see the need.

				i ripped on you about the scooter on day one zac, sorry about that, i was kidding and only just making fun, btw, thanks for the gasket material, it helped alot. <br /><br />i dont mind scoots, just the mentality some people get with them, kind of the &quot;i bought it to get around&quot; and nothing else, but you sound like youve got your stuff together and want to tool around with stuff so thats great to hear. its the people that just want other people to fix things for them that annoy me..

Does this mean I have to mod it to stay in yr good graces? It is kinda my steady-eddie... I was hoping to keep it nice and boringly reliable. (but secretly I plan to buy a new variator and exhaust when I can safely hide the expense from Heather).

				Thanks for the welcome fellas... dont get me wrong, I dont want you to think that the upgrade parts for the scoot is an excuse for not riding a ped. I have had a few peds in my time and loved them! I do not expect anyone else but me to work on my shit... if I do not do it myself, there is no way I would ever learn.<br /><br />As far as wanting one of you to sell me a ped, your prolly right =) we will just have to see how that goes, I might see one you guys have for sale and fall in love with it... I like anything on 2 wheels tho...<br /><br />i just like my current scoot cause that thing corners better than my old cbr 954RR
