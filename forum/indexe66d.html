				We just get a MO bill of sale, take it down to the county treasurer&#39;s office, tell them we bought it from someone in MO and MO doesn&#39;t register motorized bicycles so no I don&#39;t have a title and no I don&#39;t need a title, give them money, sign 10 papers, and walk out with a plate. Then they mail you a title a few weeks later. Some of the guys have had to get the mopeds inspected (it all depends on who you talk to and what mood they&#39;re in that day), but I never have. It would only be a problem if the moped had been registered in KS before, I think, and I don&#39;t think the chances are too high of that happening. The less money you put as the &quot;bought&quot; price, the less you have to pay in taxes (I usually put down $50, so it&#39;s about as low as you can go and still be believed), although there&#39;s always the $20 registration fee and a few other random fees they tack on. <br /><br />And my spring project: make all 4 of my mopeds work at the same time. 4 for 4, 100% working mopeds. That&#39;s all I want.

				but hey for real: put a low seat on a maxi N and narrow drop bars and you may never want to ride another moped again. its seriously the most controlled ride of your life. anything else almost feels dangerous and unmanagable at this point. on the maxi N its like youre basically sitting on a skateboard flying down the road.

				jimmy! i&#39;d love to blast around on your hobbit for a day.. give me a couple of months to finish the max-n and she&#39;s yours for a day.<br /><br />also, if you want stability and the throw-around aspect, get a rigid swinger, its sturdy as hell and you can still toss it around a bunch, just a little big for my taste<br /><br />nash, i have to disagree and say the moby 50vlc is the most stable bike i have ridden at speeds excess of 30mph, maxi frames (both suspended and rigid) have ALOT of flex in them, the 50vlc doesn&#39;t have that and still provides some of the throwing aspect, its why more than anything i want a rigid moby

It&#39;s too easy to set up for; they all ran oval frames, and I ran a straight (road course) frame (set up well) and went just as fast as my teammates. I would&#39;ve loved to run a road circuit, but nobody else wanted to.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="indexba23.html?topic=4016.msg46705#msg46705">Quote from: Tom! on February 27, 2010, 02:52:32 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">how fast are we talking?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>We got 22hp out of our least powerful motor; we have a 1/8 mile oval circuit at our garage, we touch 60 on our back straight.
