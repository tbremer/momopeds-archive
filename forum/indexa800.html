				The O&#39;Fallon group wants to come and BBQ a dinner for the I.R.E sometime in mid September or October.&nbsp; We really appreciate you all, and how nice you have been, and we would like the rest of our group to get the opportunity to meet you all also.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mark, If you could shoot us some dates of what would work for you all, and also what you all like to eat, we will make it a plan.&nbsp; I have this thing I do every Sunday morning,&nbsp; so we would not be able to get to the fort until about 2pm on a date of your choosing, and we could have a good dinner ready for everyone by about 4:30 to 5:00PM.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Let me know a few dates that would work for you all and what you all like to eat.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Hope to see you all soon!&nbsp;
