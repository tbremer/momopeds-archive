				Some guy in a Monte Carlo drove by and yelled &quot;Run, you faggot!&quot; Today while I was running.... WTF is wrong with people?<br /><br />I tried to catch up with him when he got stuck at the next light, I was gonna wipe sweat off my brow and head, fling it in his face and yell &quot;ENJOY MY FAGGOTY AIDS BREEDER!&quot; But the light changed and he took off quick-like.<br /><br />I figured he&#39;s too stupid to know how retarded that is, but whatevs.<br /><br /><br />I saw this one story about a guy who was running and got a giant soda thrown all over him by a passing car. He caught them at a light, found some conveniently-placed fresh dogshit, picked it up and smeared it all over their handles and windows. FUCK, I wish life would work that well for me!<br /><br />Perhaps we should alll carry around a quickly-accessed pouch of shit while riding for just such occassions?<br />

				I agree.&nbsp; That is fucked up.&nbsp; But the answer is right there - Monte Carlo.&nbsp; <br /><br />The quickly accessed pouch of shit is called you lower rectum.&nbsp; other primates produce and fling shit at a moments notice.&nbsp; Evolution has not robbed us of this skill, only social mores.

				i like the dog shit combined with a nice over the shoulder fling. you know get some air time for a spectacular crash landing. like the germans did with the v1 rocket.<br /><br />i got 2 big dogs and one small yard, with tons of fresh ammo special made just for this purpose. and that&#39;s not all. . we have flimsy as fuck sandwhich bags intended for my sons school lunch, but where stamped unfit for duty. perfect for keeping the evidence off your paws (and the inside of your warm pocket)<br />yet thin as Chrysler clear coat, for holding together while in flight but bursting upon drivers face contact!<br /><br />IT&#39;S GERM WARFARE!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />
