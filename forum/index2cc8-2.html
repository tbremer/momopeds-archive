				What is the point gap supposed to be? Ive also put in a new condenser, and made sure its wired correctly. Why the hell does this bike have so many random loose wires?

				well I took a look at it last night, tried 4 different HT coils, re-wired it and still no spark.&nbsp; something happened and I have no idea what they did to it. point gap is good.&nbsp; multimeter readings were good.

				the ground (blue/black) was toast but even grounding it other places didn&#039;t bring spark back.&nbsp; I don&#039;t quite know what happened but looking at it on my back porch last night with a work light for an hour or so... didn&#039;t bring spark back.

				That is truly zany, something must not be connecting or is shorting out somewhere. I hate electrical stuff. Did anything get damaged when they yanked the flywheel off?

				well they thought the condensor crapped out so they tore that one off and hooked up an external one and it just hasn&#039;t sparked since, I dunno.&nbsp; I know it had great spark the last time I saw it and i&#039;m sure it still did when you sold it.

				just curious If anyone has check to see if there is output from the points? and if so if theres output after the condenser? New parts especially electrical can be DOA. not trying to jump in and tell anyone what to do.

				Is it at all possible that the stator itself has a problem? Could it be one of the coils on the stator? I was as gentle as I could be when I pulled the flywheel off. Also, the only wires that me and harry fucked with were the blue and black ones coming off of the original condenser.

				I had trouble with mine grounding through the metal spark plug boot once. cut up an old plug wire from my truck and it was good as new. Also the wire corroded inside and was giving me trouble..<br />

				Sounds like damage to the stator/coil or the replacement condenser is shit. Time for an HPI Mini.

				my guess is the replacement condensor is shit.&nbsp; I have an extra one you can try if you want.&nbsp; points are good as they are brand new.
