				K, Sachs ran great all day, and today went to the sto n her, no probs, parked 30 mins, then started her up to move her into the garage and now she only drives in reverse. WTF???<br /><br />Seriously weird, it&#39;s fine for a while because I could ride backwards on my bmx a little, but this won&#39;t do.<br /><br />Jimmy, What hath become of my Sachsy? Whay would a bike just start running in reverse? Did I drop a gear or something?

				It&#39;s crazy, I started it fine, but when I give it gas, the bike literally pushes/drives backwards, so, yeah, I guess the whell goes backwards, so...theoreticaly, I was thinking about this just now, the engine could be running backwards.<br /><br />REEEEEAALY weird.<br /><br />Is it possoble to push your bike backwards, engane the clutch then get it started, it would run backwards, right?<br /><br />Transmission cover off, nothingloose or goofy, made a bit of a clinky tinky sounds thoguh when moving in reverse.<br /><br />Next week, I&#39;ll bring it to fix it and we can all take turns seeing who can ride backwards without using our feet to balance before messing with it.

				I&#39;ve heard that with some SAAB cars, you could pop-start it in reverse and the engine would run backwards, manual gearbox and all five reverse gears and one forward...&nbsp; <br /><br />Doesn&#39;t work in a Volvo motor and I&#39;ve no idea is it is possible with a 2-stroke.

				saab made a 2 stroke back in the day,,,,Yamaha,, makes a golf cart, 2 stroke, which attains reverse by running the motor backwards...but this,,,it seems like you&#39;d have to kick it backwards, to even get it to try...its the 505 , right?,, I bet something in the gearin messed up, althoiugh I can&#39;t imagine how it did it...

				It&#39;d have to be in the gearbox.&nbsp; The piston/cylinder porting wouldn&#39;t let it run backwards I don&#39;t think.<br /><br />I think your wife found out about your peds, and learned how to rip your main drive gear out and turn it around.

				I think your crank arm is rotating the wrong way....cause the crankshaft is a direct link to your gearing...take off the head-jug and see if you can get it going the other way...may take a couple times...

				Could I just try turning the flywheel the right way? or, wait a minute, it&#39;s too early for me to think.<br /><br />Really crazy, because it actually kind of rips going backwards. <br /><br />I&#39;ll try it tonight since Heroes isn&#39;t on and I&#39;ll just watch medium later (Crap, did I just admit to watching Medium?)

				your timing has slipped and it&#39;s firing really early in the compression stroke and the piston is just going back down, causing your drive gear to go backwards.<br /><br />Learned that little Sachs Phenomenon in the break down van at Louisville.

				AAAAAAAND the answer is.............<br /><br />Who the fuck knows?<br /><br />I took the fly cover off and insepcted all screws. Tight as a nun&#39;s ass, all of them (screws, not nuns). Rotate flywheel, point gaps and moves appropriately, although who the fuck knows in the right spot, I&#39;m not fucking with it.<br /><br />Refill transmission and start it up. It move forwards again. I even tried starting it in reverse and it wouldn&#39;t even start.<br /><br />So, there&#39;s the big mystery solved. Apparently I dreamed it all up with witnesses and threw a tantrum that six people apparently didn&#39;t really see and I&#39;ve lost my marbles. Well, either that or Delilah is pissed that I show her no attention in the garage and when I want her to perform between my legs I expect her to just go with it agreeably, letting me ride her all I want and when I&#39;m done I just shut her out and walk away.<br /><br />Wait, that sounds familiar.<br /><br />So there you have it. She went backwards on Sunday, and now she&#39;s back to normals. JESUS! I guess I better get that 50cc kit.
