				&nbsp;I&#39;ve been trying to figure this out. when the weather gets warmer, the molecules in the air spread out, and to maintain a ratio, lets say 15 to 1 , air to gas, one would need to jet down,,, inversely as the weather chills, the molecules pack together, and a smaller jet would make the ratio right. Right? so picture a small spring, becomes a creek, then a stream, and then feeds into a river, and then rivers, and oops, here comes a cliff, Lets&#39; get into a barrel, and ride over, NO No, lets, get on moped and ride to KC.... so anyway,,, we need a rocket sceintist to verify this, perhaps only to point out that I have it exactly backwards,,, but my contention is. Small springs make big Falls.....smaller being a smaller jet.. and ..you know...... we need a poet to make a good one... a all good boys deserve fudge, like that......Mark

				Cold/winter means that the air is more dense, which means you need a bigger jet to compensate for more oxygen getting into the combustion mix.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t put in a bigger jet, you will run lean.<br /><br />Warm/summer means the air is less dense, so you need a smaller jet to compensate.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t put a smaller jet in you&#39;ll be running too rich.<br /><br />This is why my maxi runs better on the way to work in the morning (when it&#39;s cooler outside) than it does when I head home at 4:30 when it&#39;s all warm out.&nbsp; It&#39;s also why our bikes seem to run shittier in summer.

				Gentlemen, I wish to jump into the Jetting discussion regarding weather changes.&nbsp; I don&#39;t believe we should consider changing jets with the change in seasons.&nbsp; The general barometric pressure of our location on earth does not significantly change with temperature changes.&nbsp; Yes an engine runs better in cool weather (once you get it running) because the air is slightly more dense.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, while there is a minute change in engine performance with cooler air, only moving to a higher altitude should necessitate a change in jetting.&nbsp; The density of the air is generally controlled by the number of air molecules above you pressing down on the air molecules at your altitude.&nbsp; At higher altitudes, there are fewer molecules above you, so the air is generally less dense.&nbsp; Automobile engines have, in the past, required a jetting change to give normal performance to people who permanently live in higher altitudes.&nbsp; Modern fuel injected automobiles automatically adjust for altitude.&nbsp; <br /><br />Barometric pressure gives you an indication of the &quot;general air density&quot; I&#39;m talking about.&nbsp; The average barometric pressure in St. Louis is just under 30 inches of mercury.&nbsp; Storms cause changes above and below this average.&nbsp; As soon as you make a slight change in jetting for summer temperatures, a storm would come to town and your moped would run crappy again.<br /><br />Dave

				Bah.&nbsp; I sounded like the smart one for a minute, but not now.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />So why did I have to go down 7 jet sizes from winter to summer this year?&nbsp; I didn&#39;t change anything else about my setup.&nbsp; Same carb, cylinder, head, exhaust, everything.&nbsp; (Note: I have since put a high compression head on, but that was after the jetting needed to be changed.)<br /><br />As far as I&#39;ve read on Moped Army, the rule of thumb is that every 20 degreee change in the weather necessitates 1 jet change.&nbsp; So from riding when it was 10 degrees to riding when it is 90 degrees would make me down jet 4 sizes.&nbsp; That logic still doesn&#39;t prove why I had to change 7 jets...<br /><br />
