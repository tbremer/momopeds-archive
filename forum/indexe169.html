				I decided to take the plunge and dig into my Vespa Grande. It was my first moped and I could get it to barely run at the stunning speed of 15mph. But it ran and kept on running. Well now that I know just a wee smidgen more about mopeds, I&#39;m learning how the Italians do mopeds. At first look it seems like some inpenetrable homogulation but I managed to get the engine dropped and torn down and I must say its quite impressive the way they designed this thing.

				I was equally impressed when I tore my Bravo apart. Of course, now that I want to put it back together six months later I look at the pile of parts and say &quot;hmmmmm..&quot;

				simplest moped engine I know of. 2 bearings, 1 seal. transmission outside of the case. only 3 cylinder studs. no head gasket. no intake or gaskets to speak of. no exhaust studs, nuts, or gaskets there either! and ya can&#39;t even see the engine on the bike. that&#39;s why i like vespas. <br /><br />All of these things are also why the vespa is such a PITA to make serious upgrades too.

				O.k. a beautiful engine design and then they go and cram it into a breadbox using a manuever out of tetris. Does anyone have a factory aircleaner for one of these? My 2-stroke oil bottle replacement will look janky to someone with the need to peer at its innnards. Now onto the wiring.

				Rode around the school parking lot today on the Grande. Still not very fast and it picked some bad habits hanging around the Harleys, it now marks its territory.

				Used a large soldering iron to put a new socket into the back of the CEV headlight after unsealing it. Then put in a bulb and resealed it. Some quick wiring and I now have a headlight!

				C&#39;mon Mark it has to work first, then not be a moving violation, then I study all the manuals and diagrams, consult the experts on all the boards, evaluate and plan a course of action. I don&#39;t just split a case on the first date.<br />rkboco- do you mean the bushing/spacer? and by how much, and whats the typical payoff?

				Thats the one. Just grind it down to the rampplate. Its lets you get a little more on the top. It made the grande I had break 30mph completely stock and I weight 200lbs.<br /><br /><br />What it does is let the rampplates squeeze together just a little more.
