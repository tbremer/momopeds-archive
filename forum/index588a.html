				Hey,<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever, read my posts about the chick who hurt her elbo and wants money. I posted that Its lame to put up a sexy pic of the one of 3 people who was hurt and ask for $, I am against objectification, I implore you to read EVERY post in order, and see who started what . At any rate, this foolio Zach from BM starts threatning me with his &#39;family&#39; unproveoked of course, saying how interesting would be if I showed up to the rally! Really uncool shit. So of course I wanna go now.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I just want you to read and be aware before people get it all convoluted, as they are known to do.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				So, I think I read it all...who from KC threatened you?&nbsp; They are saying you&#39;re not part of the Breakfast Mafia, but I didn&#39;t see anyone saying they&#39;d kick your ass or anything.<br /><br />Frankly, I&#39;m not backing you up on this.&nbsp; I was thinking of doing the same thing if Ryne got his hospital bill and it was crazy expensive.&nbsp; It sucks to be uninsured and have a wreck.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know first hand, but I&#39;m lucky that I haven&#39;t had to recuperate and face big bills.&nbsp; The last three people I remember having $ asked for on MA were dudes.&nbsp; In fact, this is the first girl I&#39;ve seen money raised for in the year and a half or so I&#39;ve watched moped army.&nbsp; And it was posted by her friend, who is a guy, and I&#39;m sure he did pick that photo because she looks hot.&nbsp; But to say they&#39;re exploiting that shit is off base dude.<br /><br />I mean they sold shirts in Tozer&#39;s name: //onehundred.bigcartel.com/product/moped-army-tee-shirt (//min//ndred.bigcartel.com/product/moped-army-tee-shirt)&nbsp; That is the most recent guy.&nbsp; And they did straight fundraising for him too.&nbsp; There were two more I can think of.&nbsp; One guy who worked at 1977 mopeds broke his jaw last fall or something like that.&nbsp; And another guy died from gastrointestinal cancer when I first started looking at MA like last spring.&nbsp; He left behind a wife and two kids, so they had a fundraiser.<br /><br />Now, in all of these fundraisers, they used pics that made these guys look good.&nbsp; Cool, a little rough, but in that awesome mopedder kind of way.&nbsp; So why is it special that they show a girl on a moped smoking a cigarette after she broke her elbow?<br /><br />A fellow mopedder got hurt, doesn&#39;t have the money to cover the bills, and their friends are trying to help them.&nbsp; I hope we&#39;d do the same for our StL people, so don&#39;t shit on them for trying man.

				Few things to clarify:<br /><br />Yes, Zack from Denver, co-owner of the bus.<br /><br />In context the family thing was refering to how my personal family handles things.&nbsp; I speak in no way for the denver Spokesmen on this one.&nbsp; I should have made that clear.

				I&#39;m sorry jimmy, but I can&#39;t back you up on this one. I agree <em>some</em> people of the forum have a higher tolerance for stupid things said by the ladies, but it doesn&#39;t extend past that point and doesn&#39;t really need to be addressed in the angry manner you did.<br /><br />As for this, you haven&#39;t been on mopedarmy for that long, so I guess you don&#39;t know that it&#39;s a pretty common thing to have a fundraiser for fellow mopedders who have been hurt that need it. You bring a lot of knowledge to our fix-it days and definitely don&#39;t take this as us freakin&#39; out at you. Just don&#39;t be so...meanspirited when posting. We all try to be helpful on that site.<br /><br />I&#39;ll see you sunday, sir.

				I did not expect you guys to &#39;back&#39; me, thats not why I posted this...but hey, thanks for considering, at any rate, I still think hurting your elbo does not constitute $! The chick is not even a member, and there were 2 other people who wer not hurt AND the forum moderator wrote me a long email explaining well, hell Ill just post what he said below.<br /><br />I absolutely agree with you James. The Bombshells lasted all of six<br />&nbsp;months<br />as a Moped Army branch, Carla isn&#39;t even registered as a moped owner on<br />&nbsp;the<br />site, and she&#39;s never posted there. Some commitment. This handout stuff<br />&nbsp;is<br />getting to be a bit sucky, and a few people (remember hellchance the<br />&nbsp;&#39;white<br />nigga&#39;2 weeks ago asking for a free ped)are trying to pull scams.<br />In my opinion, they played the sexist card, not you, with the photo<br />&nbsp;(why not<br />a&nbsp; pic of the wrecked bikes instead?) I mean, am I going to go on a<br />&nbsp;Volvo<br />forum and ask for donations when I get in an accident? The MA has a<br />completely bogus sense of the homogeneity of its so-called community,<br />&nbsp;not to<br />mention the self-importance of the people in &#39;the club.&#39; I posted there<br />&nbsp;for<br />eight years and let me tell you, about 90% of the people who post this<br />&nbsp;year<br />will be gone in another year or two. That&#39;s how much it really means to<br />them. And yes, you are right; chicks get the attention. It could be<br />&nbsp;because<br />they are outnumbered 20-1 by the male posters and the branch members,<br />&nbsp;and<br />they love the attention.<br />Ask the board if a scooter person were involved in an accident, would<br />&nbsp;they<br />agree to donate money for his/her injuries. Or does a lack of pedals<br />&nbsp;mean<br />they are not deserving of sympathy or help?<br />I find it completly baffling that someone would ask for financial help.<br />&nbsp;A<br />while back, I sustained two bad injuries two summers in a row and spent<br />those summers in a wheelchair unable to walk. It never occurred to me<br />&nbsp;to ask<br />anyone for financial assistance, even though I am self-employed and was<br />unable to work. I just toughed it out.<br />All of this is yet another reason that I don&#39;t post on the MA forum any<br />more. They are the biggest bunch of dim-witted, conformist underdog<br />&nbsp;poseurs<br />I have ever run across. If I need information on mopeds, I go to the<br />&nbsp;MRA<br />site. They discourage and would ban 95% of the posts that appear on MA<br />&nbsp;and<br />kick the offenders off the forum. FYI, the MA members harassed and<br />&nbsp;bullied<br />the veterans off the MA forum 5 years ago because they didn&#39;t like<br />&nbsp;older<br />guys knowing more about peds than them.&nbsp; That&#39;s how and why the MRA was<br />formed, and the moderators are really reluctant to let MA people post<br />&nbsp;there;<br />one bad OT or stupid comment and they&#39;re gone.<br />Don&#39;t take any shit

				And by the way&nbsp; my first post was just explaing why people, (before me) had a problem with this fund raiser...then I was attacked, and I defended myself and opinions. So I respect your opinions on the matter and would welcome an open debate on this topic without people calling names and threatning. General forums are for phillisophical debate. And thats what I was doing...whatever, nevermind!

				If I remember right, the other two guys didn&#39;t have any broken bones and didn&#39;t require any medical treatment.&nbsp; At least that&#39;s how I understood it.&nbsp; She broke the bone in her elbow.&nbsp; She has to have that set, and will have to do physical therapy for months to get a full range of motion.&nbsp; (I know because I had a friend break her elbow a few years back)&nbsp; This Carla girl is uninsured, so she&#39;s looking at a bill that I bet in the $30,000+ range when it&#39;s all done.&nbsp; That sucks.&nbsp; I don&#39;t mind people asking for help in situations like that.&nbsp; And she was riding a moped, with people who ride mopeds, attend rallies, and do post on the forums.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think it was out of the question to ask on MA.&nbsp; And besides, it was her friend, who is a regular MA poster who is asking for her.&nbsp; She didn&#39;t come begging herself.<br /><br />So if we did something like this for Ryne, would we be lame for trying to help him?&nbsp; He &quot;only&quot; had stitches, not even a broken bone, but I&#39;m sure he&#39;s still looking at a hefty bill.<br /><br />I never would&#39;ve posted in that thread if it didn&#39;t become a shitstorm.&nbsp; Way I see it, if you want to donate, then donate.&nbsp; If you want to send a get well soon message, then do that.&nbsp; But going on and saying the dude is being sexist for putting up a good pic of the hurt girl rather than a mangled bloody pic, and saying that the appeal for help shouldn&#39;t have been put up there in the first place because she&#39;s not even a &quot;real&quot; mopedder or whatever just isn&#39;t something I&#39;d do.<br /><br />I&#39;m up for debate, and as far as I&#39;m concerned this is all friendly.&nbsp; I&#39;ve got no hard feelings toward anyone.&nbsp; Come sunday, we&#39;ll work on peds and drink beer as usual.&nbsp; haha

				Right on right on... peerhaps Im extreamely independent minded, well hell , I know Iam, all my life Ive done things on my own, got into and outta messes on my own, so its hard for me to fathom asking for help, but hey that is my hang up I guess, I realize groups do help, and Mike, dont make this something its not by bringin Rynes misfortune into this! I feel for any 2 wheeled rider, Ive been riding since I was 12, an shit now Im 36, and Ive had 2 serious accidents! But hey, I gutted through it and perhaps if I was in a group that wouldve helped it wouldve been pretty nice. Ahhh oh well what do I think I think? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Man, I really would have handled this differently if I&#39;d known you were involved with another group...<br /><br />I think Andrew already said it, but since you only recently started posting, and most of your recent posts had been on the.. ehh.. inflamitory side, I&#39;d just figured you were some 36yo internet loser.<br /><br />Clearly you&#39;re not, and while I still dissagree with what you did on that post, I&#39;m willing to outwardly ignore it.&nbsp; But only if you&#39;ll agree to not hold me to my stupid threats.&nbsp; You aren&#39;t what I thought you were, and I don&#39;t want to cause you any phisical harm.<br /><br />And as for the slander thing..&nbsp; You&#39;ve gota understand that I love these people.&nbsp; Lester is an awesome person (who I have a bit of a man-crush on, for sure).&nbsp; What you were doing was making him out to be a liar and a crook.&nbsp; You couldn&#39;t accept that some of us trusted him, and knew that his intentions weren&#39;t what you were claiming them to be.&nbsp; So I couldn&#39;t accept your arguement past that point, and shit snowballed.<br /><br />I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m guilty of enjoying yelling at people on the internet..&nbsp; Especially when I&#39;m sitting at home sick, with nothing better to do.<br /><br />Also, I really admired how you did drop it when you said you would...&nbsp; Kudos, most people don&#39;t do that...<br /><br />~Zack

				its all cool on this end.&nbsp; As for all of us in the Breakfast mafia we know lester and he is decent and nice guy.&nbsp; as for the charity stuff.&nbsp; ..Breakfast mafia (ok mostly me because half the guys in our group wouldn&#39;t know where to start) have donated to charities other than moped related charities.&nbsp; We have helped raise money to send a teacher to Africa, raised money for the AIDS &amp; low income clinics.&nbsp; Also animal rescue groups.&nbsp; We try to do what we can when we can.&nbsp; I started all this because I broke my leg 2 yrs ago when a car hit me on my moped.&nbsp; This was 2 mths after my son was born.&nbsp; It SUCKED no money and people calling for bills.&nbsp; I had friends help out (even one of the vespa guys did my laundry)...Thankfully I had a kick ass lawyer that got the chick (who was at fault)...The money came well after the depression set in.&nbsp; The one thing that helped was that the guys in the gang where there for us.&nbsp; &nbsp;So having a gang to support you and make sure that you don&#39;t get overwhelmed and crazy is the greatest thing ever!&nbsp; &nbsp;Anywho....remember when you are part of a gang you represent not only yourself but the your gang too.&nbsp; Well I am just babbling here might be the pain medicine cause of this stupid tooth...and I hope this makes sense cause my post seemed to be missing shit...I even proof and I STILL mess it up.. but seriously....SEE YOU GUYS AT THE RALLY!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />SAN DIMAS HIGH!!!&nbsp; &lt;---movie reference!
