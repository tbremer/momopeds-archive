				So, I&#39;m thinking after the KC rally on the weekend of July 19th, we should plan some long Sunday rides.&nbsp; By that time we&#39;ll have spent half the summer fixing things and doing small rides.&nbsp; It&#39;ll be time for some bigguns.<br /><br />So where can we go?&nbsp; At the Kzoo rally we did a 120 mile ride one day, round trip.&nbsp; It was good and fun, but I think that would probably be the max distance we should try to go.<br /><br />So what is within 60 miles or so of here that would be good to spend a day going to, being there, and getting back?&nbsp; Preferably something free or cheapish.

				What would be fun and the right distance away is only accessible by going on highway 40 for a short distance.&nbsp; That&#39;s not allowed since it&#39;s also interstate 64.<br /><br />But anyway, it&#39;s to go to the wine country sites just over the highway 40 bridge in Chesterfield.&nbsp; You go west on highway 94 and there are some neat places to stop and have a glass of wine while overlooking the Missouri River valley.&nbsp; Highway 94 is a winding road with not TOO many hills to climb.<br /><br />I also ride out to Castlewood State Park on the Meramac River, and ride the winding roads west of there like Ridge Road, St. Paul Road.&nbsp; I&#39;ll need to hunt for it, but there is a small town at the end of one of those roads that was fun to see.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s by the part of the West Tyson Coungy Park that is north of the Meramac.&nbsp; The old town of Castlewood (near the park) was an old summertime destination because it had a mineral spring swimming pool we went to y-e-a-r-s ago.&nbsp; (Think smelly but cool water.) That ride could originate from my house.<br /><br />I&#39;ll try to think of others.<br /><br />Dave

				We should do an end of the season fall ride to six flags or one of the local state parks for a fun time!<br /><br />I&#39;ll start looking into both for group rates and safe routes
