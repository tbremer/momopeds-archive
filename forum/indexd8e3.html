				Anyone ever order anything from these guys? I ordered a read tube from them 2 weeks ago so when the package never arrive I called Fedex who told me that they bought the shipping labels but never shipped the package. I&#39;ve called an e-mailed with no response, anyone else have a bad experience with these yahoos?

				Yeah I&#39;ve had issues with slow shipments from them, but they&#39;ve always been received.&nbsp; I have ordered a few larger shipments never had a major issue and only a couple small issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;Try email I never called them but did email once to say if you can&#39;t ship this please cancel, I had a tracking number in an hour and the package in 3 days.&nbsp;

				I haven&#39;t had any problem with 1977 myself. Treats is quicker and they are super quick to fix any errors(and I have had a few) in my experience so they always get my business unless 1977 has something treats is out of or doesn&#39;t carry or has a stellar deal.

				Haha, awesome Tom. Yeah, I almost always go with Treats who have never steered me wrong, they just didn&#39;t happen to have a tube when I was looking. And based on your advice I e-mailed Dan directly and the package got shipped today so all&#39;s well.
