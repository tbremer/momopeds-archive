				Brian really stepped it up this year in religiously attending TNR&#39;s so I think we should make an effort to meet at the park this and every Thurs until he gets better. When he hears that we all are doing this, Im sure it will lite a fire under his ass to get better.<br /><br />Last Thurs, we went to Walkers and had a beer and talked about going to the Sauna at the Y ( right next to the park). For meditative and spiritual purposes, I think IRE needs to do this together. I dont care if its me and one other person. IRE needs to focus energies in a postive manner for ourselves as much as for Boner... I mean, Brian. <br /><br />SO this Thurs 7 ish ( after supper), rain or shine, drive or ride...meet at the park then go to the Y. Its a small fee, but well worth it. We need to. <br /><br />Post only if you are coming, if not, we dont want to hear your lame excuse (Brians pet-peeve)...<br /><br />EDIT...non IRE are more than welcome as well.

We just meet at Carondolet park, we are gonna go for a Sauna at the Y and then a beer .... course we&#39;d be more than happy to see you and Brian&#39;s brother!!! We could then go to Walkers on Gravois ( around 9ish) new spot not far from the park, that Brian and the gang had started to frequent as of late. Anything we can do in the meantime - DONT HESITATE TO ASK!<br /><br />

				I know this is gonna sound crazy, BUT, could we all try to arrive at the park at 7? Its gonna take a while to get in the Y and all, and I really need some deep deep meditation in the sauna/ steam-room. Been a hellovaweek at my school. They loaded me down with over 35 students, I have started to lose count! The only thing that keeps me going is knowing Brain is hanging on to dear life and if he can pull through that - I can pull through this!

				I may meet up with you all when you are at Walker&#39;s (they have trivia starting at 7:30). I&#39;ll call Phil and see what is up once I am finished with my duties. <br /><br />The sauna is in the indoor pool area at the Y. There is a steam room right next door as well. There&#39;s also a giant hot tub. They do supply towels.

				Cool, I get it, its cool to criticize IRE , but IRE never says shit about other gangs. Whatever, this was for Brian, not another attempt to cheap shot IRE. If you hate, keep it to yourself. I m tired of people who feel its cool or ok to criticize US for not riding - when some of us do and some of us dont. What other group even HAS a scheduled ride night besides the HR&#39;s ? Even if one or two folks show, IDK. At least the torch is lit for those who dont need #&#39;s to feel an affiliation towards a group. I am IRE through and through. Hell, I might be the last member standing, FUCK IT! Im loyal and Ill keep my head up knowing without IRE - THIS WHOLE SCENE WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED! It seems some of you are bitter and want us to fail or quit. But just remember who was there 4 1/2&nbsp; years ago, alone on this forum. And remember we never criticized ONE single group. Now, if your not in our group, IDK what you think! Got it!???<br /><br />DO your own thing, leave if you need to. Ill be here, Ill be at the park riding THURS nites until Brian is better and that&#39;s the main point. <br /><br />JIMMY IR FUKKING E<br /><br />PS this is not directed at anyone in particular, but this whole mentality that&#39;s been going around, just negative and SUUUUUCKY!&nbsp;

				The I.R.E sparked the HR. Aaron and I went to the fort to trade a kayak for a moped ( no trade was made ) Mark invited us to ride in the rally (MLC1). When we went to church that sunday and started telling people about the rally showing them the pics, telling them about the cool people we meet and what a great time we had others wanted to start riding.<br /><br />We are all in this thing together. We need to show the love to all the Missouri gangs.<br /><br /><br />MUCH LOVE TO THE I.R.E.<br />that&#39;s the way i feel about it hope i did not speak out of turn.

				Yeah, there were moments on the long river trail ride, that, I was having weird transcendent moments in time when the forest came up with the rivers edge as we were riding next to the colored tiles on the wall and we were all just humming along at the same pace...<br /><br />then Scooter stole my gas...<br /><br /><br />

				Oh yeah then there was the noobtacular gas fiasco...Phile&#39; thought he ran out, so I started prepping my bike to be a gas donor, thus turning the gas &#39;off&#39;, but then he figured it was a loose jet and I forgot all about turning my petcock off and&nbsp; after several roadside minutes&nbsp; -figured it out! Then, we go to the gas station for a gas whale spout!<br /><br />Aftermath below...<br /><br /><br />

				It was pretty funny, because people were going nuts when we got there because the Cards were winning.&nbsp; Then there was like 5-7 minutes of people just yelling FUCKKK, then people started leaving, then it was sad and quiet.<br /><br />Also, some random guy in a big SUV asked if we saw a 5&#39;8&quot; 150lb kid wandering around.&nbsp; He said he&#39;d been missing for 8 hours.&nbsp; Uhhh
