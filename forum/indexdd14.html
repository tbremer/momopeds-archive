				k so i have a friend who asked me to take a peek at her moped (1978 vespa bravo w/ variated rear wheel) ive worked on it before and just done little things. well she said that recently it has been acting sluggish and wont make it up hills anymore, im thinking its the variator. i have a couple of questions.<br />1. Are you supposed to grease vespa variators? my first guess was the variator weights are stuck out. maybe seized variator?<br />2. Any other ideas guys? im too not familiar with belt driven bikes so idk if something could happen with the belt to cause sluggishness.<br /><br />thx babies

				I think the stockers use a little bit of grease. Id check the gear oil in the rear hub too...and check the belt and tension.

				Mark got those carb bushings from ZippyMoped... but no matter.&nbsp; <br /><br />Owning two 1978 bravos myself (and only one is running right now :( ) I&#39;ll suggest a few things that I&#39;ve learned the hard way&nbsp; <br /><br />1) Plug fouling kills the performance more than anything.&nbsp; I learned this the hard way.&nbsp; Even stock setups get fsckd. Pull it, clean it, replace it.&nbsp; It does wonders...&nbsp; Poor engine performance is just as sluggish as a slipping belt.&nbsp; You can&#39;t necessarily that the engine has low power tell until it is under load.&nbsp; <br /><br />2) Stock belts (w/o teeth) get glazed and start slipping under load - especially noticeable when you try to start the bike.&nbsp; <br /><br />3) I&#39;ve greased the shit out of my variators and it does very little to change performance.&nbsp; <br /><br />4) if the variator side plates are moving (independent of the main cylinder), you will lose power.&nbsp; If the rear clutch pads are oily or wearing out, you will also lose performance.&nbsp; <br /><br />5) Partial gas starvation will also kill performance (yeah duh right?).&nbsp; <br /><br />So... I recommend you determine if the engine is low-powered, or the drivetrain is not working correctly.&nbsp; Clean everything with break cleaner and try it yourself.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#39;s my Nickle.&nbsp; <br />
