				A front page article in today&#39;s (June 30th) Post Dispatch reports that &quot;Dirty engines from China (are) a problem in U.S.&quot;<br /><br />It seems anyone can order a shipping container full of gasoline powered equipment, from generators to mopeds and those engines are polluting the air more than engines produced in the U.S. with government specifications on exhaust emissions.&nbsp; How much more?&nbsp; The article quotes one sale of 200,000 chain saws that will pump out 268 tons of carbon emissions over the lifetime of those chainsaws.<br /><br />In the future, the EPA might try to track those chainsaws (and generators and Chinese mopeds) to their current owners to get them removed from service and help reduce the smog problems in some cities.&nbsp; Can anyone say &quot;PopCycle?&quot;<br /><br />Next they might try attacking mopeds created before smog emissions were of interest.&nbsp; Lawn mowers are already of interest.&nbsp; An Internet search for &quot;emissions from lawn mowers&quot; found the sentence &quot;One old gas powered lawn mower running for an hour emits as much pollution as driving 650 miles in a 1992 model automobile.&quot;&nbsp; Today&#39;s article reports lawn mowers and other small engine equipment might soon be required to have catalytic converters to reduce emissions.&nbsp; That won&#39;t make them cheaper to buy.<br /><br />Well, I need to stop writing this.&nbsp; I gotta&#39; go fire up my weed eater and my lawn mower and cut and trim the grass.&nbsp; Oh, and I have been meaning to do a test run of my backup generator.&nbsp; Put on your gas masks!!!!<br /><br />Dave

				Well, ye olde PopCycles actually adhered to all EPA and DOT guidelines, so I&#39;m pretty sure they weren&#39;t the &quot;dirty&quot; engines.&nbsp; But they sure as hell were cheap and Chinese.<br /><br />I think we should propose a more logical ban.&nbsp; The chainsaws, weed whips, lawnmowers are all just tools we use to fight the real enemy: nature.&nbsp; We need comprehensive legilation to ban nature.&nbsp; Because making things illegal always gets rid of them.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; Just like there are no more drugs or terrorists in the world.&nbsp; Because we banned them.&nbsp; Behold the mighty power of a politician&#39;s pen.
