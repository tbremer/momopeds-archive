				I&#39;m seeing a lot of Maxis that are ridig, and have a crossbar added. Whats with that? Is the crossbar just for extra frame strength or rigidity. I figure it&#39;s about going faster, but to me, it kind of looks stupid.<br /><br />Anyone?

				When you make those rigid frames too fast they can break on that seam below the tank.&nbsp; So a crossbar gets added to give strength.&nbsp; Triangles are stronger than a U.<br /><br />I&#39;ve got a rigid maxi.&nbsp; It&#39;s going to have a removable crossbar, not a welded in one.&nbsp; I think.

				So, if I want to get a Maxi and kit it out then i need to consider that too? I don&#39;t want to race you or Tom or anything, i just want to get it to about 40 or 45 MPH.<br /><br />Right now, i&#39;m trying to plan out an rough idea of what I need to do. I&#39;m looking Maxi, sort of cafe racer type. I don&#39;t mind adding a crossbar if it&#39;s necessary. Would you have to fabricate a removable one as well?

				At 45mph on a normal maxi with suspension, you probably don&#39;t need to worry about the weld breaking.&nbsp; It&#39;s the people doing 70mph that really need them.<br /><br />A rigid maxi over stock speeds should probably have one.<br /><br />And they sell removable ones.&nbsp; All chromey and such.&nbsp; Under $30 usually.

				since i am hitting ish 50 (when my cylinder is installed - Thumper come through!!!) I have kicked around the idea of welding a cross bar into my bike, but I really like the way it works.<br /><br />However, it doesn&#39;t feel squirrely to me, so I haven&#39;t bothered, yet.

				I like real hippies.&nbsp; It&#39;s the scene hippies that suck.&nbsp; They&#39;re just posers.&nbsp; I knew this girl at my college who went to my high school.&nbsp; High school was suburban, preppy craphole.&nbsp; College was a cool hippy town.&nbsp; Well, I see her at college after not seeing her in like 3 years, and she&#39;s a complete hippy.&nbsp; Hippy dress, unshaven legs/pits, no shoes, chanting with other hippies in the grass on the quad.&nbsp; (Yes, it was common for hippies to be chanting on the quad on nice days)<br /><br />Well, then over the summer, back home, I see her at a BBQ and she&#39;s all dolled up in heels and a sundress sipping some wine.&nbsp; Total poser hippy.<br /><br />Those are the ones that suck.&nbsp; But the people who live it are cool.

				I used to live in Olympia Washington, Hippie capitol of the planet. oooh i HATED those goddamned hippies.<br /><br />REAL hippies were ok, but then there were tons of useless layabout fucks who would crap up all the public parks and beg for money and leave trash everywhere. At least once every time I went for a run, one of these assholes would either purposely walk right in front of me or they would blow smoke in my face while I was passing them.<br />I had a mantra while running &quot;Finishing the training is more important than jail....&quot;<br /><br />Fake hippies SUCK! Especially the worst are the ones who only dress and act that way so tehy can feel comfortable smoking pot. d00d, if you wanna smoke pot, just fucking do it.

				drum circles are awesome when done right with talented players and quality instruments. OR when a big group of people get their shit together and can &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; do it with trashcans.<br /><br />I think Portland is the hippie capital, Seattle attracts a bunch of squaters.
