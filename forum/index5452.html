				i went to the barfley davidson museum a coupla weeks ago with my family. i had REALLY low expectations and expected to see a bunch of shitty faux choppers and fat weekend warrior/losers. <br /><br />turns out, not THAT BAD. you could take pictures. they were having speical displays of all black mc gangs which were really cool. <br /><br />turns out the first harleys were belt driven mopeds. i do not know why i didn&#39;t take pics of those...i wasn&#39;t even high. they did have recordings of the engines. <br /><br /><br />my favorite were the board racers. no brakes or starter clutches and hand pumped oil injectors. RACE TILL YOU RUN OUTTA GASS! i guess they used to have a thunderdrome in kc. the videos of them racing were SICK. <br /><br />that awesome stand up sidecar was on a indian. dunno why that was there. <br /><br />all in all it wasn&#39;t as bad as i thought. we went at a good time so that there wasn&#39;t tons of shit hawks there. i really love the early pre ww2 bikes.

				My Sportster is just like a huge Puch. You work on it a lot, it takes a lot of work to make it reliable, you spend a lot of time waiting for parts, and the feeling when it all comes together is bliss. <br />The factory tour in K.C. is a blast too. We should have a ride up there.

				I don&#39;t like harleys current lineup but they did made some cool stuff a hundred years ago. The sport bike they made is pretty cool too. The Mungenast motorcycle museum has one and I get a little wet looking at it.

				i worked on chili&#39;s hd over the winter. swapped the engine over to a new rigid frame, mounted the fender (from a trailer), seat, oil tank, hid the coil and cut off all the stock brackets, drilled holes in the frame and ran the wires through, rewired the whole thing (hardwired), made that chain sissy bar, etc.. check out the front wheel has no brakes! in exchange for all my mopeds painted :)

				I currently run without a front brake on my Sportster, but that&#39;s because the brake caliper is a one year only and they are rare as hen&#39;s teeth.

				Who needs front brakes, you only generate 70% of your stopping power with the front brake.
