				So I have looked online and im just trying to find the way the stator plate should look on a za......the way i have been told is that the points sit at like a 1 o clock or 2 o clock but it seems the only way I can put the za stator plate or e50 stator plate is at more like a 7 or 9 o clock.&nbsp; Does any one have a link or a pic of there shit so I can get this bastard running?

				Yup I remember you saying that but, you now have leaky seals correct? Higher viscosoty fluids will build more case preasure, to much preasure and you will start blowing your tranny fluid past the crank seal. From what I have read on MA and seen through this forum, 12oz is a good safe fill point. Gives you some slip to help you hit second about 20, also gives enough fluid to hit that crank bearing ;-) The seals and clutches in this new one look PRISTINE! <br /><br />I will probably go up to 12oz of Type F in this one to help offset what the porting will take from the bottom end.<br /><br />I have avoided the clutch flip in both the ZAs due to the total pain in the ass of removing them to replace the ones you&#39;re going to blow up. Changing the pucks is not that bad! A one time deal if you take your time and do it right.<br /><br />

				i checked it and it wasnt the trans seal, that was fine as it turned out. looked for oil when i popped the top end off, was just fine. what was causing the issue was the over pressure from the MK on the flywheel seal.

				Kind of off topic, but on an e50 there is that little lip and then behind the wall it drops down to a hole that vents to atmosphere.<br /><br />If you were to build that wall/lip up could you put more fluid into the case?&nbsp; Better cooling for the clutch maybe?&nbsp; More slippage?

				I really don&#39;t think the issues is over filling with ATF for more / less slip. I think the issue is ATF.<br /><br />And, are you talking about the vent hole thats at the very top back side of the case?

				Is that one at the top? I guess it is isn&#39;t it. The part on the inside by the vent is what confused me.<br /><br />I was more interested in keeping the slipping clutch cool, and I was wondering if more fluid would do that.

				I think it&#39;s going to be pretty hard to keep that cool. And I mean, relative to the cylinder, head, and exhaust that part of the case stays very cool.<br /><br />The reason I say it&#39;s the ATF is that once it gets to running temp clutches with ATF seem to slip less, but I have used 5w30 and 0w20 now instead of ATF and they don&#39;t seem to present the same problem<br /><br />Just my thought.<br /><br />How would you go about keeping it cooler?<br />I am not sure what you mean by the part on the inside, the humps around the vent? Let me see if I have a photo somewhere...

Loads of clutch slip, no wear thus far, and I put that clutch in a couple weeks before the Austin rally. It&#39;s the cheap, off-the-shelf, Ace brand welfare oil. I told Desperado about it in Denver, he tried it out and loved it; now I think most of the Cold Trailers are running it. I assume it&#39;d do just as well in a ZA.
