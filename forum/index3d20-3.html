				Yeah yeah, we&#39;ll all put them on Facebook (you better, anyway), but let&#39;s put them here too. <br /><br />A summary:<br /><br />After donning cheesy sweaters, getting gas, and taking Mike back to get his Vespa (since the Pinto developed a lack-of-compression problem), we were on our way. We made it to the pumpkin patch without incident and acquired popcorn, cookies, and apple cider (seriously, that&#39;s the whole point in going). Some of us got pumpkins, but none of us had actually brought anything to tie them down with. Mine fell off the back of my moped in less than two miles. After that, we rode out to the overlook. Brett&#39;s Bat was going at least as fast as my Slowmos, which pissed me the hell off (stupid Tomos), although I was one of the few people who made it up the hill at the overlook without pedaling (yay Tomos!). <br /><br />Oh, and there were cheesy sweaters. Lots of cheesy sweaters. Some woman at the pumpkin patch said mine was the best... I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a good thing though, especially since everyone else had to go to the Salvation Army to get theirs, and mine came from my mom&#39;s closet... Also, I wore a cape. <br /><br />(http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs216.snc1/8329_758134959469_16831557_42935043_6454488_n.jpg)<br /><br />(http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs216.snc1/8329_758134999389_16831557_42935049_4527170_n.jpg)<br /><br />(http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs216.snc1/8329_758134989409_16831557_42935048_3852973_n.jpg)<br /><br />(http://photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs236.snc1/8329_758135004379_16831557_42935050_7738561_n.jpg)<br /><br />(http://photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs236.snc1/8329_758135009369_16831557_42935051_2151305_n.jpg)<br /><br />(http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs236.snc1/8329_758135014359_16831557_42935052_3071262_n.jpg)<br /><br />(http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs236.snc1/8329_758135019349_16831557_42935053_5997441_n.jpg)<br /><br />(http://photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs236.snc1/8329_758134964459_16831557_42935044_2552375_n.jpg)<br /><br />(http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs216.snc1/8329_758135029329_16831557_42935054_2500833_n.jpg)<br /><br />(http://photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs236.snc1/8329_758134969449_16831557_42935045_1401600_n.jpg)<br /><br />(http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs236.snc1/8329_758134984419_16831557_42935047_5452226_n.jpg)<br /><br />

				I suppose Mike and Daryl already know about this, but for those of you who haven&#39;t seen this exchange, here&#39;s a little bit of lingering fun from the ride:<br /><br />http://lawrence.craigslist.org/rnr/1427176023.html (http://lawrence.craigslist.org/rnr/1427176023.html)<br /><br />http://lawrence.craigslist.org/rnr/1429303834.html (http://lawrence.craigslist.org/rnr/1429303834.html)

				If you push &quot;reply&quot; you can get his craigslist-ified email address. Someone start an email exchange with him so we can get his actual email address and let&#39;s sign it up for gay porno newsletters.

				If you guys want a real e-mail address for the guy, you have to e-mail him and pretend to agree with him. &quot;No way! I saw those jerks too! They were totally being irresponsible, and I&#39;m glad you called them out..&quot; blah blah blah. Then if he responds (and he&#39;s more likely to, because you agreed with him), you&#39;ll have his real e-mail and you can send him all the spammy e-mail you want. I feel like it&#39;s traditional to sign people up for Rebook e-mails, but hey, whatever floats your boat...

				I&#39;ve got a holiday sweater to end all holiday sweaters. I wish I could of busted it out and come to ya&#39;lls ride.<br />Oh and that craigslist shit is surreal. Very very funny. That guy must be fuming around his house, tearing apart pictures and cursing after that succinct reply from mike Beez. Awesome!<br /><br />
