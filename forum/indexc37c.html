				i have a cheapie, the major differences are tone, sustain, and tuning, the neck on mine isnt set right so is not really in tune, i may tear the frets out and throw filler in there and a chunk of brass on the headstock and see if that helps and run fretless. <br /><br />denser wood (usually) = better tone. the friends Uke was a piece of work, it was beautiful and very well made. no branding, just carved polished and very well worked Koa.
