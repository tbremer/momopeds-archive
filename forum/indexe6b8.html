				noooo, its generally a pain to get in but it does go in, sometimes easier w/out the carb on but it is definetly feasable.&nbsp; You can fix it but no reason to hack up the sub frame randomly.&nbsp; It would be sort of funny if you had to take the motor off to avoing melting the fan shroud when you weld it back up.<br />Or is this a silly joke, in that case I am a sucker for falling for it.

				Tee he!! hehehehe!!&nbsp; Hahahaah!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I though it was funny!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;VM6<br /><br />&nbsp; But for-real Guys!!! Its a great fucking idea for a Vespa Motorcage 6000!!! lets you test your motors and if you need to take the motor out and pull the flywheel to make an adjustment you dont even have to take the carb or the clutch/variator off. NO SHIT!!&nbsp; Saves lots of time!! I cant tell you how many times i have had to go through that fucking mess. Keep in mind nuuuuubs to vespas this type of machine is not just for jetting. This type of machine is for trouble shooting and for tunning. This type of machine is for everything. The point of it is and you will completely under stand when its done is to do all the motor work off the bike and once the motor is running great you put it back in the bike. When you rebuild and kit a motor you have to go through the entire thing top to bottom. Thats what this machine is for. I know You guys are like what the fuck is he talking about??????<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Now, i also interviewed the guy who owed and operated this grande with the frame cut like this at speeds up to 35+ MPH. Believe me I asked a ton of questions when i had the opportunity. He weighted 155lbs and said he had no negative side affects. He also said he used to drop the bike a lot on the left side so the lower sub frame is a little dented on that side. I was hoping to study it once it gets here to see if i could read any stress marks from riding with it cut like that. For instance cracking welds or twisting of the frame etc. So hopefully i can tell the difference of him dropping it on its left side and the stress from the cut in the frame. We will see MUHAHAHA!!!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; I have this sick ass foot stool that im going to destroy and use the metal tubing from to create a base and handles for the Vespa Motorcage 6000, Its going to be so much more advanced then the first one i helped build. And way lighter too, with many new options I cant wait to share with all of you and it comes together. Dont worry i will be sure and post plenty of pics along the way. This picture is the one i got while it was still on the grande. Its currently being shipped to my house as we speak. I don&#39;t plan on answering any questions. Although I will take suggestions but that does not mean I will use them. <br /><br />It all comes down to this Mark and I worked on vespa motors while on the bikes for months, then we worked on vespa motors while on the Vespa Motorcage 1500 and there was a world of difference, if you dont believe me you can go ask him. Or keep working on your motors the same old way and use your legs to turn that bitch over ever 2 min to see if it will start. <br /><br />&nbsp;These will be major assets for vespa fixits but we will need more then one so i hope as my build wraps up other people jump in and build one. I have one more of those foot stools for a base and handles.

				No you sure dont! I do points adjustments with them on. Keeping the variator /clutch on the motor is not that big of a deal to me though anyway i prefer to take it off to make it easeir to get to the points Mark would do more adjustments with them on then me. Im more concerned with keeping my carb on and retaining a air tight seal once ive got one. I have to keep buying new shims they stretch out and harden to fast. They just become leaky. So i would like to got a good seal and keep it. The only problem is you have to get it back on the bike like that. So thats the next stage of my project.

				So you are going to ride it like that?&nbsp; You can change jets with the carb on the bike from underneath, so no need to damage the shim/seal on the carb.&nbsp; You can adjust the points on the bike, so unless there is major problems. no reason to take the motor on and off.&nbsp; <br />I am looking at ways to brace by subframe, but I do suppose weight reduction makes sense.<br />

				&nbsp;Mine works alot different then yours. first of all mine goes to one number it does not jump all over the place, and it also holds the number once your done with the test, then you release it after you are finished reading it by pressing the button on the side, your button is on the back i remember. I did a test on every one of my motors that i used yours on recently and they read quite different readings. Mine gives an exact number, and its always lower then what we were deducing with yours. Im not knocking yours im just saying mine reads different. Its possible that one of ours might be broke. I would be more then happy to do a comparison sometime.

				Well Declan forget about the carb and the variator and the clutch staying on the motor. Thats all advanced stuff i will get to later. The stuff i know you can benefit from is stuff like how me and Mark built and then tuned my Fast Blue motor on the first MotorCage. We also did a complete stress test and once we were through we put the motor on the bike and all that was left was to dial in the variator. The Motorcage has its own ignition coil so your able to trouble shoot that as well, you can access all sides to do a complete compression test, case, base gasket, head, and intake manifold etc while spinning the motor with a drill and no fuel. Im telling you this machine is going to have all the old benefits plus a bunch more your just going to have to give me about 2 weeks and you can watch it unfold. I will take pics and describe it to you as i go. I have a lot of ideas and im going to share them all. It really does make a huge differance when trouble shooting and tunning motors. If you are just going to simply jet up one jet then of course you would not take your motor out, come on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean with in reason use your head, most of the things i have done are serious kitting/ tunning jobs, and or major trouble shooting where we have tried every thing and the motor needs to be out of the bike. <br /><br />&nbsp;By the way as far as that goes Declan and Mark, Im not rebuilding my motors, I have found that my motor had compression to low to run, so I have been under the impression that my compression was higher and i was going fucking crazy wondering why my motor would not start!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; I now know why. If you gut is telling you one thing and other people are telling you other shit, listen to your gut!!!&nbsp; I thought I was going crazy. I was about to beat my motors up with a sledge HAMMER!!!!! I went and bought all the shit to rebuild them both. So, just finding this out im hoping that this in the primary reason for mine not starting. I just don&#39;t have my motor cage yet and im going to wait until i do. So i can do a complete over haul/ inspection.<br /><br />

				One thing im trying to do is level the playing field, because vespas have this imprisoning exoskeleton where as most other moped motors are free and bolted to the frame with a 270 degree open easy access setup,,,I would love to create a new motor bracket all together for the Bravo and Grande out of billet aluminum that only covers the bolt holes instead of the whole motor and then reconnects to the frame and shocks and kickstand,,, that would be sick,,, Can anyone here run a CNC Machine?

				Fabrizzi makes a billet subframe for thier crazy badass motor, be a good one to look at for design cues.<br />There was a guy on MA that was going to build some cool looking subframes for about $100 a pop, may be interesting to see what it would take for him to follow through, he said there was not enough intrest.

				Bright is a pretty nice guy in person, bit ecentric but nice.&nbsp; He likes his peds and puts some time into things.<br /><br />People are giving you good advice, no reason mark or anyone else cant give you good advice, kitted or unkitted, there are not that many things that can actually be wrong with one of these silly peds, especially a vespa. <br /><br />Bright, I think if you tone down your posts and try hard to be extra polite and not over bearing with your opinions everyone would back off your case.<br />You have to be overly polite on the internette with posts or you can come off sounding like an ass.&nbsp; Little different for some of these other folks that actually hang out on a regular basis-they can screw with eachother and have a better understanding of each persons personality.<br /><br />

				&nbsp;Thanks for the pipes Nathen i<br />&nbsp;chopped one of the headers off and i think it will work fine just as it is as a universal hight flow pipe thanks. I also found that my race pipe fits on it pretty good, so I imagine a lot of pipes will fit but the point of this machine is so that you don&#39;t have to disassemble your bike, that includes taking your pipe off. Anyway here are some picks and i also wanted to point out one other item with this machine that people are probably saying WTF!!!!! GLORY HOLE 6000 well I put a hole in the back of the panel so you can shoot starting fluid or fuel mix straight into / or be able to see straight into the carb. If you have ever tried to do this on a vespa / prime the carb, you know what im talking about. So yes i solved yet another pain in the ass problem that you go through while trying seal and tune your upgraded performance Vespa motor. I start my first complete compression tests tomorrow on both my motors. From there I will know if i have to either seal more, the motor is good and tight and my problem lies some where else, or i need to rebuild because the case is leaking, then I can move on to the tunning stage. I will get some video of the testing tomorrow.<br /><br />(//i870.photobucket.com/albums/ab270/brightbrightbrightbright/IMG_0639.jpg)<br />(//i870.photobucket.com/albums/ab270/brightbrightbrightbright/IMG_0635.jpg)<br />(//i870.photobucket.com/albums/ab270/brightbrightbrightbright/IMG_0638.jpg)<br />(//i870.photobucket.com/albums/ab270/brightbrightbrightbright/IMG_0640.jpg)<br />(//i870.photobucket.com/albums/ab270/brightbrightbrightbright/IMG_0643.jpg)<br />(//i870.photobucket.com/albums/ab270/brightbrightbrightbright/IMG_0644.jpg)<br /><br /><br />

So how was I suppose to know, and why did he get all offended and pissed off at me for offering. After that he was a huge dick to me and he instigated every one else to be&nbsp; huge dicks to me too. Tom was in the center, I wanted it all to go away. You guys remember it well. I fucking do. You all were relentless fucking with me. It really stressed me out to the point that now when I post shit just want to come out of my mouth do to all the resentments I have pent up. Garret your being a total hypocrite because its you being picked on this time and you can push the buttons then some could say you are exactly what I called you for even giving me a waring when you didn&#39;t give warning to those who ganged up on me in the past. If you would have read the post where I said I will humble myself in order to move forward and left my profile alone. I did not plan to delete posts anymore because Tom and I were going to work together and finally work through all the bullshit and I would have been able to drop all of my pent up completely justified anger towards you guys. From the hundreds of insults you guys said to me about me my things my being!!! Its like your a republican your blind to your surroundings. So look im extending my hand this offer one last time, have a meeting about it with Mike pee and a few other level headed intelligent adults don&#39;t answer to fast, think about the good that can come of it . We can even do a probation period where you guys give me back my profile abilities for a month if at any time I delete shit for reasons other then editing then remove them and I will except that with a smile and still work with every one as that is my promise to you and my friends and every one here.. The point is i will make a commitment here and now to devote myself to working together with each of you whom I my have some resentment towards to get past it and bring unity back to IRE and stop all this nonsense.&nbsp; At the same time I hope there are others that learn something too. Also Garret I would like to apologize to you for calling you names. I only hope your equal with justice from here on out and treat other as you would treat yourself. There i&#39;m being the bigger person and opening myself up and offering my respect / which means i will work on treating you all with nothing but total respect. If we are to work this out one of you as a speaker is good that way nothing is lost in translation. You don&#39;t have to tell whats going to happen if i do this or that I understand. I have put several hours of thought into this and im making a formal commitment if you all agree to do the same as far as respect and give me my editing abilities back on a trial one month bases I will give 110% to the unity, and total respect to all IRE members. If i complete the month with out any problems then I get it back for good. Obviously you can take it away again but thats not in the contract. Its not going to happen. I also could have sent this as A PM but I chose to post it for all to see so you would be fair.<br />&nbsp;

				Keith, I didnt want to ride your cb or buell because they&#39;re expensive bikes and I dont know you. If something were to happen while I was on said bikes I can only imagine what your reaction would&#39;ve been. If it was Beez, Matt, Mike, or Garett&#39;s I wouldn&#39;t have hesitated. I spent a bunch of time last week on a ninja, and own a motorcycle.<br /><br />Also, I think as a possible character flaw, I&#39;m never ashamed of the things I do.<br /><br />If I treat you shitty it&#39;s because you&#39;ve treated my friends shitty first.<br /><br />I&#39;m all for civility, but I&#39;m not convinced you&#39;re sincere.

				On my drive home, they were talking about engine stalls in light airplanes and how pilots instinctively want to pull up to regain control.&nbsp; However, on light planes this kills the engine, the pilot, and the passengers pretty quickly.&nbsp; <br /><br />What you are supposed to do is put the nose down (which is counter-intuitive) but it allows the plane to get lift under the wings.&nbsp; This allows the pilot a chance to regain control.&nbsp; <br /><br />The discussion was in the context of the Air France disaster last year.&nbsp; &nbsp;Information on that disaster is still fragmentary, but it seems the pilots were fighting stalled engines for 3+ minutes before the plane was ripped apart.&nbsp; Data seems to suggest that they kept trying to pull up to restore control but in fact it only made things worse...<br /><br />They did draw a sharp distinction between an air-liner and a light plane in terms of the success of this maneuver... <br /><br />(edited for typos.. somewhat, I&#39;m hardly perfect)

				Despite the fact he&#39;s been acting kinda fucked up, it is not especially cool to gang up on someone and try to tear the guy down further.&nbsp; <br />I&#39;m not defending the way he&#39;s been acting in the forum, but if his behavior is unacceptable then kick/ban him.&nbsp; End of story.&nbsp; <br />

				Nicely said Mark.&nbsp; <br /><br />Folks can form their own opinions based on their own personal experience.&nbsp; But I&#39;ve hung out with Bright a few times and I think he&#39;s a decent guy - wants to help.&nbsp; Works hard. Maybe lacks the governor on the comment button.&nbsp; You could do a lot worse.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Bright fucked up his back working on bikes.&nbsp; I think he was lifting a moped (or scooter) when he pushed it a little too far.&nbsp; One little moment that changes your life.&nbsp; You can&#39;t tell me that some of you haven&#39;t met that juncture of your own lives.&nbsp; The same could happen to any one of you guys.&nbsp; <br /><br />if you&#39;ve met him in person, does his on-line presence jive?&nbsp; Seem like exactly the same fellow?&nbsp; I&#39;m not making an excuse, just offering some context.

				hey this one time i crashed a moped and collapsed my lungs and now i owe 100,000 dollars... then my gf broke up with me and i have no credit now. <br />but im&nbsp; decent dude, fuck bright forever no excuses..... we have all been through shit in our lives. People making substance based excuses is THE MOST tiring and ridiculous thing ever. More people need to be responsible for their own actions. orange robin is a great friend in person but on the net he gets stupid, thus he is banned. just because you like bright in person doesnt mean necessarily that he should be allowed to do whatever he wants online.

				^ +1 <br /><br />Mike put it best, OrangeRobin is a really cool guy in person, but acts a fool on the internet. I&#39;ve met bright once and he seemed decent, but then again, you end up remembering all the BS from online and it creates a tension. ESPECIALLY because most of us know each other only through forums and text on a screen, what you type and say becomes YOU. If all you know about someone is their douche-wizardry online and someone else saying &quot;oh, well he&#39;s alright in person..&quot; what are you more likely to expect when you meet them?<br /><br />The way I see it, if you&#39;re going to say it online, you better be prepared to say it to their face too. That alone helps keep alot of BS down on my end. we&#39;ve all pulled dumb shit on the internet, I know I did. but then again I was 10 and the internet was this big new thing. and was dial-up. <br /><br />but I digress. If you suddenly become this almighty douche-lord when you have a screen and keyboard separating you from the other person, you need more self control. This situation reminds me of the O.R. stuff. <br /><br />This forum is a privilege, not a right.

				greg and mike said it best.&nbsp; yeah, kevin seems like a good guy in person but I have yet to actually utter one word to him because his douchery online has really soured his image to me in person.&nbsp; I trust that if mike likes orange robin but agrees to keep him banned then it&#39;s a good choice.&nbsp; same goes with bright.
