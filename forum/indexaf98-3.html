				I figured out why there was a nail stuck into the clutch, the bottom of the case (where the clutch arm bolts on) is broken, gone, totally snapped off.<br /><br />It&#39;s a $100 part, but that also means I am going to be rebuilding a Laura m48. Boo!<br />So, I need: Bearings, Seals, Gaskets, etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />BUT! It also means that this is a winter project, my old motor is going on the new bike, and I can finally see what makes one of these m48&#39;s tick.<br /><br />I&#39;m excited, a little annoyed, and super ready open of the reed fitting, intake, make a bata-fast.

				tom,<br />I&#39;m the guy that sold you the yellow Bat. Sorry to hear that about the part costing so much. Obviously well beyond my skill set, so I couldn&#39;t tell ya about it. I&#39;m trying to arrange some stuff so I can try and ride with you guys and gals sometime, or at least come hang at a fixit day. Hopefully I&#39;m still welcome after the bum clutch purchase! I&#39;m trying to brew my own next weekend, so maybe I&#39;ll be able to bribe you guys to let me hang with my home brew in the future<br />magma.

				It looks like the person who spent the most time with this bike laid it out pretty bad, all of the cable guides were ducked, the rank, the case, and the back wheel were all bent. I didn&#39;t notice this and I am hoping you didn&#39;t aswell.<br /><br />I&#39;m not pissed at you, so don&#39;t be worried to come by.<br /><br />You&#39;re home brewing? Where&#39;s you get the supplies? Are you brewing kits or your own mix? What style?<br /><br />You should totally come by sometime<br />&nbsp;soon. Any progress on the Puch?

				&quot;ducked, the rank, the case, and the back wheel were all bent. I didn&#39;t notice this and I am hoping you didn&#39;t aswell.&quot;<br /><br />Naw, I noticed the wobble, but I really never saw it until you got on the bike. I thought I might have the skills to put it back together,(how hard could it be?!) but I learned real fast I know next to nothing. I really hope the thing gets moving, and in my inexperience in selling it, I can now only offer my limited help in getting it moving. That amounts to me sitting there and nodding and asking questions and drinking beer while you bust your knuckles. Really, anything, I&#39;ll try and help. <br /><br />As for the beer, I got a kit for Christmas last year that is sitting in the basement begging to be attacked. I&#39;ve never brewed, but I dedicated a day to it this weekend. Just mix stuff, but our friends own a homebrew supply, and they pretty much rule. They make REALLY good stuff. They have brewdays as well, which are full of a bunch of great stuff. You should check em out. <br /><br />Not much progress on the Puch lately, other than trying to seat some stiff ass NOS tires, I ordered a Proma Gp pipe today. I am a total newb to the mechanical thing, and I&#39;m trying to learn asap. I figure I&#39;ll take it one thing at a time until I know enough to justify kitting. SO much to learn. I want to be able to keep up in the 40mph range with it so I can get across town without dying. We&#39;ll see about that. <br />My schedule for the next month is screwed, but if I get any time at all, I&#39;m coming knocking. Sometimes I can&#39;t sleep thinking about this stuff. Anybody ever put a snowplow on a Puch?<br /><br />And the Regency, you can ride it, but ya cain&#39;t have it!<br />magma

				On a Puch, you can do 40 on a stock cylinder with a performance exhaust, a bigger kit, and a dremel.&nbsp; If you want to get in the 50+ range, you can get just a small kit.&nbsp; If you want to get in the 60+ range, you can get a big kit.&nbsp; I take my magnum (big and heavy and slower) on I55 on the way home from work daily now.&nbsp; I&#39;m hitting low 50s, but it&#39;s fine for rush hour highway traffic.<br /><br />I love working on Puchs, especially ones I haven&#39;t touched before.&nbsp; Bring it on Sunday!&nbsp; I&#39;ll be happy to poke at it.&nbsp; We&#39;ll get it fast.&nbsp; You should get a 15mm bing, or preferably a small dellorto PHBG if you want to go fast on the stock cylinder.&nbsp; The proma GP is a good pipe for a stock deal.&nbsp; Great low end, and better than stock on the mid and high ranges.<br /><br />My girlfriend&#39;s dad got me a homebrewing setup for Chirstmas last year.&nbsp; We finally got around to using it like 7 weeks ago.&nbsp; We just sampled our first brew, steam ale, and it&#39;s damn good.&nbsp; You won&#39;t regret getting into brewing.<br /><br />Come on Sunday man!

				wow, I need to start reading my posts before I post when I use my phone...<br /><br />Molds have kept me up many nights, it&#39;s part of being an addict. You&#39;ll soon realize that real life plans are meanngless unless they involve peds, so is school, work, and relationships... U less your Parker is into mopeds aswell. <br /><br />Where is this home brew place and when do they meet? Having beer and mopeds come together was tv best day of my life

				Mike,<br />Thanks for the info, that&#39;s kinda a summation of all the questions running through my newb mind lately. I&#39;m already thinking 40mph ain&#39;t enough, judging by the assface rednecks that can&#39;t handle 30 in my town. But I&#39;d like to build up to it, for lernin&#39;s sake.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been informed by said wife that I won&#39;t be brewing beer this weekend, in fact, I&#39;ll be working at her store in Belleville. I knew this, but my memory is very selective. I&#39;m supposed to pump the &quot;Strange Folk&quot; festival in O&#39;fallon,Ill. Kinda like the rock and roll craft show, but way bigger and outdoors. Could be a nice place to ride if yer feeling Illinasty. <br /><br />BTW: Can you take a moped on metrolink or the bus? That could make things fun.<br /><br />As for me dying to hang out , I&#39;m gonna shoot for Sunday, but it might be hard with this festival thing we have.&nbsp; I&#39;m done by four, and I&#39;ll be priming the better half all day for my departure, but alot of work. <br /><br />What time do you get together on Sun, and when is to late to drop by? I&#39;ll try and bring the Puch if it&#39;s not gonna be to late, otherwise I&#39;ll just say hey. <br /><br />stoked

				Definitely start my learning a stock Puch (which isn&#39;t hard) and then move on to kits and big carbs and such.&nbsp; I rode a mostly stock Puch for nearly a year before I got into making things go fast.&nbsp; Having that base o&#39; knowledge helps.<br /><br />We&#39;re at Mark&#39;s from noon until about 8pm on Sundays.&nbsp; If you get out at 4, you&#39;ll be hitting prime fixing time.&nbsp; Come then!<br /><br />I don&#39;t think they&#39;d let mopeds on a bus or metrolink, but it&#39;s worth a shot.&nbsp; Metrolink I can just about guarantee they wouldn&#39;t allow, but maybe you could get it on one of those racks on the front of a metrobus...maybe.&nbsp; But really, why not just ride it?

				Tom,<br />This guy has some Batavus stuff on Ebay, clutch stuff. Not sure what you are needing.<br /><br />Btw, what&#39;s an &quot;ing&quot;?<br /><br />And I&#39;d like to&nbsp; ride over, but it&#39;s a hell of a long way through East Boogie and such on an iffy running bike. I&#39;m ten miles from the river, and then on and back later after beers. That could end up tragic on the Puch as it is. But one day it will happen.<br /><br />magma

				Doh, you can&#39;t even pack heat in Ill either.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t ride through EStL without my best running bike and a sidearm, but that&#39;s just me.<br /><br />Tom likes to post completely incoherently.&nbsp; He meant a ring.&nbsp; Piston ring.&nbsp; Blech.<br /><br />You still need to come sometime, Magma.&nbsp; We&#39;ll get that Puch running its best.

				I think we could make a nice fix on that clutch arm, with a drilll, and nuts and bolts. Bingo could get a job at any cycle shop truing wheels, quick, and perfect.
