			Anyone wanna ride On the 4th? Was thinking about buying and shooting off some fireworks somewhere(OFallon)and then later cruising up to the TR Huges firework display.&nbsp; I could even maybe grill some food on a weber. Anyone else got any ideas or want to ride?!

Further reading the article it says we cant even shoot them in our back yard because we are within a 600 feet of a church...<br /><br />http://ofallon.patch.com/groups/editors-picks/p/personal-fireworks-displays-outlawed-in-ofallon-allow92e6817c49

			And the Honda ran fine the 1 ride I took it down the street. Maybe ask the guy who rides it every day. I think his name is Jason.
