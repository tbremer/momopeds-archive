				Sitting here with Florissant Dan, we just Re-installed his Carb on his Hobbit.&nbsp; &nbsp;The thing is backfiring a lot and won&#39;t start and the plugs end up wet after pedaling a bit.&nbsp; Any Suggestions?

				Make sure none of the wires got pinched when you were putting the frame back on the sub-frame, also check your plug gap...

				Clean the carb again X 18...seriously, it could be one of those tricky air passages that are clogged....Remove every single thing from the carb run guitar strings (little E) through parts, clean clean clean!

				BAckfire USUALLY indicates timing. But since the timing is &#39;set&#39; then it could maybe be a point gap issue. Re-check all wriring, and seriously, clean the carb until you just cant stand it.

				one thing we noticed while peddling for what seemed like eternity trying to start it last night, was smoke coming out between the case and the clutch/ variater ....would that be,piston blow by or crank seal? this was smoking from just peddling , not running, cause it had not started.. what u guys think?

				so just got a new kok on mah hobbit. she does not want to idle for ANY amount of time. but once you push her off she&#39;s good to roll. pretty quick. but if you don&#39;t feather the throt when stopping she will all the way. sprayed carb cleaner all over here while i was lightly reving her and that didn&#39;t do anything. guy who had me said he cleaned the carb gud. tried adjusting the screws but that didn&#39;t help much. <br /><br /><br />also, will anyone have a tap set handy? pedal and arm are stripped. weah.
