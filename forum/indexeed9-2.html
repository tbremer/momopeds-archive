			Hey guys, I&#039;m back! I&#039;ve been too busy with work and figuring things out that I haven&#039;t had time to mess with bikes as much as I used to. But now I caught the bug again. My roommate Mitchell and I have been working on his maxi for a while now and it gave me the gumption to pull my old build out and start working on it again. <br /><br />Looking forward to spending quality time with my dirty moped finger!
