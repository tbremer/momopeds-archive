			Just curious to see what others in town are working on. Plus I&#039;m new to the momoped site so hey to everyone! I know nobody really with the exception of a few I haven&#039;t talked to for almost a year around town. I currently am wrenching on a pug 103 with various parts on the way from treats. Fingers crossed for 40mph!&nbsp;

			I got the del 15,15 carb with malossi intake, a Doppler single reed, umm let&#039;s see derestricted pipe just to start. Being as its freeze your fuckin face off outside I haven&#039;t even looked at it for a week though. I also took all that rear fender stuff off so it&#039;s just the frame and seat. I just wish it would warm up! How&#039;s about you?
