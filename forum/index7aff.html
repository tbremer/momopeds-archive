				I&#39;ll be at that rally. It&#39;s some of the best fun I&#39;ve ever had. From what I remember from last year, the registration fee is only for people who want rally packs, food, and party/event access. The big rides were pretty much open. But I&#39;d ask the Mad Totos first. They like mopeds too! They really wouldn&#39;t have any problem with mopeds showing up for the meet n&#39; greet stuff, I don&#39;t think.<br />Btw, the Mad Totos are some of the coolest people ever. I seriously would not want to be a dick to them, or to their rally. They&#39;re also friends w/ the Crusaders, who, if I remember correctly, blocked traffic for the last KC moped rally?

				Scooters are only cool if they are vintage..

He kept ripping by us and shit.<br /><br />I have no way of contacting those people. You have to register to get access to the site.

It was probably a Vespa, if I know the Crusaders any, but that&#39;s just a guess. I agree that vintage scoots are much cooler than modern ones. The Totos ride about half vintage, but the rest of them are diehard riders too, not the &quot;get off your throne&quot; type. That&#39;s pretty much what the rally attendees are like too, mixed vintage/modern, but all diehard, no morons.<br /><br />...playing &quot;my moped/penis is better than yours&quot; with people you don&#39;t know is only gonna make people not like you. I know you&#39;re joking, but still...<br />I&#39;ll ask them. You only need to register to get access to their forum not the site, but I already have an account.<br />Also, the rally probably won&#39;t have events @ Vespa KC. The Totos mostly operate out of Scooterworld. Oh, and, while I really wish they did, no Vespa dealer is gonna have parts for Piaggio mopeds. All the current dealers started from when Piaggio returned to the US in 2001 or so. That means no parts inventories stretching back to the 70&#39;s.&nbsp; For the US market, Piaggio doesn&#39;t support parts for anything they sold in the US prior to 2001 either.

				My shits not faster at least it should be lighter.<br /><br />Scooterworld sounds like they sell crappy chinese scooters to the masses. I&#39;d prefer the vespa shop b/c at least they sell something with a higher quality, plus you dont get the douches looking for the cheapest scooter that will run forever without maintinence. At least the rich people are willing to pay people to work on their shit. The people with shitty cheap chinese scooters typically throw them in the gutter and go buy another. <br /><br />Besides the scooter scene seems to be too exclusive. Never seen a group of scooters riding together... mopeds are a must in KC.

				ummm kevin.&nbsp; The Mad Totos have been to everyone one of our rallies.&nbsp; They are very supportive to us since we started as a group. I will not tolerate any shit talking.&nbsp; Also the Breakfast Mafia doesn&#39;t care what you ride as long as you are cool.&nbsp; OH last year one of the mad Totos (Aaron) lead the cops away for the rally on his scooter.&nbsp; So I personally will kick your ass if you say another word and i&#39;ll do it with a smile.&nbsp; I respect that you have your opinions but don&#39;t become a fascist about scooters vs mopeds.&nbsp; I am not really in the mood to have to do damage control about this.&nbsp; Fuck when my friend had a huge lose in her family a lot of the mad totos came to her benefit show.&nbsp; They support their local community, each other, and us.&nbsp; Oh yeah I am also a member of the Mad Totos website.&nbsp; They have invited us to a few local events that they knew the mopeds could keep up.&nbsp; Aaron the had the yellow puch is friends with a lot of them.&nbsp; So i am sure he would not be happy to know the people of the Breakfast Mafia was talking crap about good decent people.&nbsp; Shit some of the members have restored old mopeds that they have found. They keep an eye out for us and even did blocking at both rallies.&nbsp; I could go on and on about these guys. The are friends of the Breakfast Mafia.&nbsp;

				Matt has one....so what does that mean. &nbsp; Well we have been rejected by others for a scooter before. &nbsp;It pissed a lot of people off cause Matt&#39;s back up bike was a scooter. &nbsp;WHO FUCKING CARES!!!! &nbsp;IT HAS TWO WHEELS SAME AMOUNT OF DANGER WHILE DRIVING. &nbsp;SERIOUSLY WHO FUCKING CARES what type of body that it has!! WHO FUCKING CARES WHO FUCKING CARES For fucking serious STOP!!! WHO FUCKING CARES....this whole idea of hating someone cause they own something different is stupid. &nbsp;I have to deal with Douche bags every night that want to tell me their opinions WHO FUCKING CARES!!! &nbsp;Kevin this thing with scooters caused a shit ton of issue 2 years ago....i will not have it start again(we where on the side of the scooter). &nbsp;ARGH!! FOR FUCK SAKES quite acting like the Bush Administration....except the fact and show tolerance for those that do NOT share your views on scooters...Chinese or otherwise. &nbsp;Fucking FUCK!! &nbsp;I am not pissed off but seriously stop. &nbsp;Why is it you can own 50 mopeds and then get condemned for owning one scooter. really...really....<br /><br />BTW have you driven a 150 cc scooter before.....you really don&#39;t want to take your hands off the handle bars....AND WHO CARES IF THEY WAVE!!&nbsp; THIS NOT HIGH SCHOOL as long as your friends respect you who cares what the rest of the world thinks.....

				You break a chinese scooter, its broken for life. I&#39;ve never seen matt on a chinese scooter. <br /><br />You can be on whatever side you want chuck. I stand by the fact that the chinese scooters are crap replicas of the good shit, they just dont pay shit for labor and... thats how you get shitty bikes. They dont have fedral mandates on what they can put in paint.. ie.. lead..I dont buy chinese crap and I expect my friends to do the same. At least if you buy a kawizsaki or Suzuki, or toyota or honda, you know the company has done a pretty good job keeping their reputation. Some of these scooters have hilarious names and even worse track records. I&#39;d find it hard to purchase one if you know its gonna fall apart and parts are going to be hard to find.<br /><br />I dont hate scooters, I just hate cheap knockoff scooters... you&#39;ll never see the companies with any patentns on cool new designs or anything. They wait 5 years for the original pat. to wear out, then duplicate the design. <br /><br />If I put a 150cc motor on one of my peds, you guys will never see me wave at anyone ever again...

				I love how <em>boy wonder </em> generalizes all people with scooters the same because of one or two instances with them. &nbsp;All people are different. Just because they own a scooter does not mean they are all the same. You are so prejudice, and a moron. Why do you call me a douche when you dont even know me? <br />Missouri does not need that kind of company, so stay the fuck out of my way at MLC rally or I may kick your racist, prejucice little tail feather.

				Since when is hating chinese scooters considered racist, or predjudice. Maybe if China made better quality shit, I&#39;d buy some of it. I&#39;d rather waste my money on american made crappy stuff.<br /><br />I&#39;m not in here to start a fight, but I&#39;m coming to MLC and I&#39;m not going to be talking shit, but if your gonna try and be an asshole b/c of some rando post I made about scooter, then your just too lame to realize I dont care. Hell drive your chinese scooter. I&#39;ll let the old guys tell you about how your helping to ruin the economy by paying money to a country who still uses child labor. <br /><br />Or you could just talk shit on my italian peds, cause they are so janky and unreliable, get horrible gas mileage or the quality is poor... make fun of me all you want.. <br /><br />I really dont have any beefs with anyone, but I dont like it when I am all nice and try and wave, and people act like &quot;who the fuck is that guy&quot;... shit cant people be nice these days.<br /><br /><br />BTW that scooter that dude used for the rally blocker last year was totally awsome, can anyone confirm its make/model. I think he stuffed a 250cc motor in it... he told us it was a 50cc. Those dudes with the Cushmans were also awsome.<br />

				You are pre-judging all people who own scooters the same. thats prejudice. Your past comments on this web site and MA make you a racist.<br />You dont know why people buy chineese scooters. Helping ruin the economy?&nbsp; Wtf. I got a $600 check from uncle sam last year . Gas was on the way to $4.00 a gallon. I was broke and having trouble putting food on the table and paying bills and putting gas in my FORD truck, OLDSMOBILE car, and my DODGE van. I needed something that was cheap and good on gas. So I took that check from uncle sam and bought the only thing that I could afford. In 4 or 5 months it paid for its self in gas savings and helped me get by untill gas went down. I knew chineese scooters arent the &quot;coolest&quot;. I dont care it got me to work.

				Scooterworld will ONLY sell quality scoots. They&#39;re the Bajaj, Genuine, Kymco, and SYM&nbsp;dealer for KC. No Chinese shit there.<br />Chinese scooters are terrible. The people that buy and ride them are often times not into the riding scene, it&#39;s just cheap transportation for them. Doesn&#39;t make them bad people, just cheap and with different priorities. Which would also help explain why they don&#39;t wave; they just aren&#39;t aware.The best thing that can come of them are the people will get into the scene and get a better 2-wheeler. (like Matt! :-) )<br />There&#39;s nothing scary about taking your hands off the bars in a 150cc+ scoot. Unless you&#39;re a scared n00b rider, of which there are many these days. (not saying you&#39;re a n00b Chuck, just that there are many new folks riding, what with the price of gas and all)<br />There&#39;s 2 different kinds of scooter folk. The scooterist who is the hXc rider that is into the scene, and the scooter rider who just wants a cheap way to get around. Please don&#39;t go lumping them together, as they&#39;re as different as the Harleys and crotch rockets.

				Mattso, dude dont go calling me out b/c you dont like my views on chinese shit scooters. I never said shit about you, now you wanna start some crap with me. I think you&#39;re lame shit if your just here to start a fight. I made a post about this to be funny and yet still get my point across that I dont like chinese scooters. I guess you ride one, or you wouldnt be so sour about it. I dont really care if you ride one, its your money and your life... but not waving at me... thats dick in my book, especially if you see the person all the time. I usually give the surfs up (pinky and index finger raised)... the motorcycle people almost always give a gesture back.. cause they is cool like that<br /><br />If you dont like the shit I have to say on the internet, or you think I am racist or whatever, I dont really give a shit what you think of me. I know who I am, I know I&#39;m not racist, I know I am only a dickbag part of the time, but yeah I say what I want and if people take shit out of context then thats on them, not me. I say shit in fun and some people have a bad day or some shit, and take shit wayyy to seriously. People like that need to chill the fuck out. I mean is it really worth it to get all worked up about some lame comment that really didnt make any sence anyways? I dont care and I dont think others should care either.<br /><br />Maybe my signature needs to say &quot;Dont take my posts seriously&quot;

				alright alright alright....this is starting to feel like another website i know.....Kevin I understand that you personally have a higher standard of what you like to drive. BUT stop already...we are friends here....I hope...but you do need to see other peoples side also. &nbsp;I am not mad at you but we got a lot of shit when a picture with lizard boy, a porn star, one scooter, and 10 mopeds was blasted due to the one scooter. &nbsp;Most people stop me on the street cause they know that i drive something with 2 wheels....most of the time they have NO clue what the differences between a moped and a scooter. &nbsp;Least of the quality of different brands and models. You might not agree with them about their choices... but its their choice...not yours on what they own or drive. &nbsp;Be cool...I have plenty of friends that own anything from 1968 Vespa all the way to a scooter (from china). &nbsp;Yes I have seen Matt on a scooter....he worked at a scooter shop. The best thing you can do is respect what people believe (you don&#39;t have to agree). So in Kevin&#39;s defense he is a nice guy. &nbsp;he would help anybody that asked for it. He is our friend right or wrong. &nbsp;So please when we are ALL together in St Louis we should have a beer, breath, and tell awesome stories of the moped life:) or start a bar fight with with car owners. &nbsp;

I made a post about this to be funny and yet still get my point across that I dont like chinese scooters. I guess you ride one, or you wouldnt be so sour about it. I dont really care if you ride one, its your money and your life... but not waving at me... thats dick in my book, especially if you see the person all the time. I usually give the surfs up (pinky and index finger raised)... the motorcycle people almost always give a gesture back.. cause they is cool like that<br /><br />If you dont like the shit I have to say on the internet, or you think I am racist or whatever, I dont really give a shit what you think of me. I know who I am, I know I&#39;m not racist, I know I am only a dickbag part of the time, but yeah I say what I want and if people take shit out of context then thats on them, not me. I say shit in fun and some people have a bad day or some shit, and take shit wayyy to seriously. People like that need to chill the fuck out. I mean is it really worth it to get all worked up about some lame comment that really didnt make any sence anyways? I dont care and I dont think others should care either.<br /><br />Maybe my signature needs to say &quot;Dont take my posts seriously&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I took it personaly because you were talking about scooter people, of which I used to be and still own a scooter, as &quot;get off your throne&quot; people,&quot;judgemental assholes&quot; &quot;throw it in the gutter and buy another&quot;. I am not like that at all.<br /><br />When you make these coments about theese scooter folk you are talking about me and choices I have made about My form of transportation. I strongly disagree with these generalizations that all scooter people are the same. I am sorry I even responded to any of this. I know you have a reputation for pissing people off and I should not take anything you say personaly. Actually I should not even read anything you write. <br /><br />Sorry BM for any disrespect to your peeps and I look forward to Missouri Loves Company with our out of town friends!
