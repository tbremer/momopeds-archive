			<br />
			So a buddy of mine is building up his express.&nbsp; We already kitted carbed and piped it but now we have a urban bottom end we are putting on it.&nbsp; Can I just swap over the points off the regular express to the urban bottom end or do I have to stick with the cdi set up of the urban bottom end.&nbsp; If so does anyone know how to hard wire a urban cdi set up?

			yes you have to stick with the urban cdi, it is inverted ... take it off and look at it, it&#039;s weird.<br /><br />you can put a HPI on it if i&#039;m not mistaken with very minimal work.

			<strong>R.I.P.</strong>:

			a regular express runs backwards into that gearbox. the problem is the points being setup on the wrong side of the cam, and there is a big difference between hobbit/express and urban stator mounts.<br />are you guys trying to hard wire that urban cdi? i might have a diagram
