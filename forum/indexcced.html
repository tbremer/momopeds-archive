				Hey now, my buddy out in LA has one of these. He wieghs about 80-90 lbs and used to have it kitted. He had to put it back to stock, but let me ride it. Thats how I got stuck on the 2 speed A35 motors. A little work, after stock and even a non kitted one is fast as shit.

				I dont dig the gaudy stickers but the bikes are pretty quick out of the box. About as close to varaiated as non variated can get. 2 speeds are a lot cooler when they arent za50&#39;s.

				I emailed tomos man. I also found a golden bullet, a lot further away. What&#39;s the deal with the golden bullets? are they as easy to upgrade? It looks sooo much better than this sprint. It&#39;s also pretty clean.

				Okay, I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m drunk now, and that I was drunk then, and that Topher was drunk then, but...<br /><br />In Louisville, Topher was talking about how the A3 is an under-appreciated bottom end, and when paired with a newer a35 top end it is unstoppable.<br /><br />Remember, booze + me knowing nothing about Tomos = me not guaranteeing my statements.

				the guy emailed me back, all excited that I&#39;m interested. I dunno, I&#39;ve left my hobbit at home wounded.

				Actually Graham from the forums said pretty much the same thing about the A3 being underappreciated. And some guy on the PT forum just kitted his and seems tickled pink with the results. Like I said, I think I&#39;m biased against them.
