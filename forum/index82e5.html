I thoroughly enjoyed the whole weekend. I had a back injury a week prior to the event and almost cancelled going. I figured if I couldn&#39;t handle riding my bike for the entire ride then I would of just rode in the breakdown truck for awhile and let one of the other guys in the truck ride it. I am glad I came down though. It was great seeing all you MO people that I have grown to love over the years.<br /><br />Sorry about my video&#39;s. I am the first to admit they are crap. They are what they are I suppose. Filmed from a cheap $18.00 camera.<br /><br />Here is another one:<br /><br />//www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSQ46FOcMog (//www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSQ46FOcMog)<br /><br />Then I have a couple of videos from my Nikon.<br /><br />There is you guys doing &quot;The Harlem Shake&quot; :<br /><br />//www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QzMg2imLkQ (//www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QzMg2imLkQ)<br /><br />And then there is my short tour of the party at like 3:30-3:45am, which also includes the story of Harry and Honey Bears tent:<br /><br />//www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRRhxZDk-qg (//www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRRhxZDk-qg)

				Going through nearly 30 gigabytes of footage at the moment. Thanks to all who took the time to talk to me instead of have fun. I wish my helmet cam hadn&#39;t crapped out at the overpass skate park, though. I think the battery died, which corrupted the last file. Oh well I still got some fantastic footage and met some rad folks.
