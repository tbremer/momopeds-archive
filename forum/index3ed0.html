			<br />--- Quote ---Jessica M. Hahn<br /><br />I&#039;ve decided I need to move a vehicle off my property since I have two project vehicles currently that are priority. I have a 1978 Yamaha XS500 that needs to go. It&#039;s a fairly rare bike that&#039;s needs a substantial amount of work. The title is kind of wonky right now. I will give you the title I have plus all bills of sale and some paperwork that could help it get titled. I am not wanting much money for it (private message me offers and/or questions). ALL of the proceeds from the sale of this bike will be donated to KOPN community radio station. You will need to haul the bike yourself as I do not have a truck.<br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />I&#039;ve never seen this bike, but it belongs to my friend Juice (I don&#039;t know anyone who calls her Jessica) who works at Eastside and Wise Guys.<br /><br />If it interests anyone, I can send her a FB message or whatever. <br /><br />I&#039;ve done the Vermont title thing--it&#039;s easy, if that&#039;s an issue.<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, on my similar Yamaha R5 I think I put about $700 into it, but maybe a little more.<br /><br />Her FB post should be attached below.

			It is a good idea to do just that because it is not very affordable.

			The site has not caused widespread searches, more than ever before, making the web as a whole came out very well.<br />
