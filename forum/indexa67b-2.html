				I got this old rat bike that is a heap of parts from all over, but mostly pit bike equipment.&nbsp; &nbsp;I must say for the 4 hundred bucks I have in it (almost all engine since it is a honda xr50) it is a very reliable mode of transportation.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />But alas, it is just too ratty for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;It needs some work.&nbsp; I heard spring break was coming soon so I started ordering parts.

				First on the list of parts is a new rear shock.&nbsp; Riding this POS is like being a fatty on a pogo stick.&nbsp; The play in the rear suspension doesn&#39;t help inspire confidence while cornering either, so the pivot bearings need to get updated.&nbsp; &nbsp;Another minor issue is my lack of rear brakes.&nbsp; Guess I should get some that work.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Perusing the world wide interwebs I came across a site that had a complete rear end with 12&quot; wheel, disc brake, and rebound adjustable shock on it for $260 something shipped.&nbsp; I was planning to spend that much on just a shock and some brakes, so I nabbed it up.&nbsp; While I was there I got a 72cc kit too.&nbsp; I figured since the rings need replacing I might as well replace the cylinder and piston at the same time.&nbsp; At least the logic seemed good at the time...&nbsp; &nbsp;Eh, $70 for a kit, I&#39;m worth it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also hate that the gastank is so fawking small and short, so I have this garelli tank here that would look pretty dope.&nbsp; <br />

				So I figures that since the rear wheel is going from a 10&quot; to a fatty 12&quot;&nbsp; the front wheel needs to be redone too. <br /><br />I have a few options here.&nbsp; The front hub is 28 hole and I have some 17&quot; rims here from a botched order that are 28 hole too.&nbsp; I also have some spokes here that would likely work.&nbsp; I would really prefer a 16&quot; so the wheels aren&#39;t so damn different, but I don&#39;t have anything but 36 hole rims in 16&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I can either deal with a 17&quot; rim, or I need to buy a new hub (or wheel).&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><br />If you give a mouse a cookie...<br /><br /><br />And since I am redoing the front wheel I need to change the steering angle so that the increased trail doesn&#39;t kill the handling.&nbsp; &nbsp;Might as well weld up a new frame.

				I thought I would be slick and use parts that were sitting around here to lace up a new front wheel.&nbsp; Old front hub, plus new rim I have here, plus 12ga spokes I already have = almost there.&nbsp; The spokes are a good 5mm too short for a 3x lace, so it is just close enough to really piss me off and not actually work.&nbsp; I do have the right size spokes for a radial lace, so I may do that just to get me running for a short moment.&nbsp; Not the safest lace, but I would rather ride a ratty bike than drive a car.

				Got the rear end in today.&nbsp; Looks like a 14&quot; rim would be about as big as I can go.&nbsp; The swingarm is thick and huge too.&nbsp; I will need to grind off some gear cover for it to fit.&nbsp; I am not sure if the chain will clear the top and bottom of the swingarm either, with the small cog on the motor.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The new shock is also much longer than the original.&nbsp; I will make another shock mount and put it where needbe.&nbsp; This frame is going to get some hacking. <br /><br /><br />Found an old pic of when I first put it together.&nbsp; So clean!
