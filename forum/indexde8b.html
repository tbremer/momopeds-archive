				She&#39;s alive!&nbsp; Kinda.&nbsp; I wore myself out trying to pedal-start it and confirm fuel, fire and compression before I realized that I had reversed the ignition switch and headlight wires. <br /><br /><br />At first she fired up and revved very nicely, but when I actually tried to ride it in the empty lot next door she died and I could barely get it started again.&nbsp; I repeated this several times with progressively worse running.&nbsp; Eventually, revving resulted in a very delayed motor response and then little at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />Were this a car, I&#39;d strongly suspect that the carb is out of tune.&nbsp; Too weak, maybe an empty fuel reservoir...&nbsp; I know SU carbs pretty well, but know very little about the Del&#39;orto carbs.&nbsp; I did disassemble and clean the carb before I put the bike together it seems simple-enough but you never know.&nbsp; While I have a spare that I can tinker with, I really know nothing about how to tune this sort of carb.&nbsp; I did not see a mixture adjustment at all.&nbsp; The idle seems to be adjustable with the cable/throttle apparatus.&nbsp; Beyond that...?<br /><br />Can anyone point me to an info source on these?&nbsp;

				Carb or timing<br /><br />Your tank seemed clean, but put a filter on anyway...then check the stator, is it advanced or retarted....advanced is opposite engine rotation...you want it in the middle for stock. The points should be gapped about a business card thickness...<br />And anyway... &#39;It Ran Earlier&#39;...sounds like your destined to bring it to the fort on SUN....see you there!

				Scooter, thanks for the pointer.&nbsp; I&#39;ve already got an electronic and a hard-copy.&nbsp; It did not quite have the detail I am used to in a service manual, but the info was good enough to get the bike back together.&nbsp; The symptom list did not seem to contain my problem - at least not with a solution that I&#39;ve not already done at some point.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jimmy,<br />I checked my gap while trying to diagnose the no-start condition.&nbsp; The manual said 0.4mm which is a really tiny gap... As far as timing... I put it all together and lined it up with the woodruff key.&nbsp; Is there something else that is adjustable in regards to timing?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#39;m thinking this is a carb issue.&nbsp; I found this site (//www.ducatimeccanica.com/dellorto_guide/dellorto.html) and since I have a couple spare carbs, I&#39;m gonna try and figure it out.&nbsp; The carb sounds a lot like an SU in design and function.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#39;m still unsure if I can make it down to the fort this weekend.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to be able to drive there on the bike.&nbsp; The Bravo does not fit into my little volvo trunk very well.&nbsp; <br />

				Yeah the whole stator plate that the coils are attached to, turns like 1/2 in. in either direction....advanced/retarted the happy medium in between in what you want, perhaps this is the culprit... or the carb :)

				It occurred to me that this carb might not be matched to this engine.&nbsp; The carb that came with the engine was missing all of it&#39;s throttle assembly and the lever for the choke plate was broken, so I swapped it with one that came from a Ciao model.&nbsp; It should have thought to check the jetting before I buttoned the whole thing up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ah well.&nbsp; One more thing to check.&nbsp; <br /><br />Been doing garden, house, and family stuff all day so I&#39;ve not taken a look since my first post.&nbsp; <br />I&#39;ll pull the carb and check it over when I have a chance.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for the info so far.&nbsp;

				Does the jet size vary at all with the application (ciao/bravo/grande/si) - assuming it is still a stock engine?&nbsp; <br /><br />There are something like three different metering needles for nearly every application of the SU carb for several dozen possible needles and at least three different jet sizes...&nbsp; I am used to finding mis-matches.&nbsp; Maybe that&#39;s not an issue here...

				its probably crap in the tank, now in the carb, gummin up the works, makin it out run the bowl , can&#39;t fill as fast as your usin it. If it was runnin sorta good, the electric is good enough. sometimes if it runs okay until you put it under a load, it&#39;ll mean something more serious like compression (rings)..<br />&nbsp;All that needle, jet , stuff is more fine tuning, I&#39;ve got a good running ciao, you can trade carbs and see if can gum mine up, or better , make yours run right, isolate the problem...

				also look inside the carb where it gets skinny through the venturi. see if its the same size hole inside there. on my bike there are two different carbs that look identical from the outside. one is a 10mm venturi the other is a 12mm. just for comparison for shits and grins

				It seems that the engine originally came with a 12.10 carb, which I reinstalled.&nbsp; What I see for sale are 13.13 carbs... does this make a huge difference. <br /><br />Both carb bowls are leaking, but they appear clean throughout.&nbsp; Jimmy (Gymmi?) stopped by and looked at my carbs and gave me a couple bits of advice and info.&nbsp; <br />Seems there are no metering needles - just this gate-thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did a compression test.&nbsp; My cylinder has 110 psi of compression.&nbsp; Normal?&nbsp; A little low for a car engine, but here that may be fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />I found the idle adjustment and got the bike to idle and even drive around a bit.&nbsp; Throttle response is a bit delayed and the bike looses power and stalls pretty quick.&nbsp; It will idle just fine now.&nbsp; My sense is that the carb bowls are being emptied and not re-filling quickly enough to keep the engine going.&nbsp; <br /><br />My guess would be a problem with the needle-valve/float bowl setting.&nbsp; <br /><br />I plan to order a carb rebuild kit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Enjoy your day at the Fort.&nbsp; Seems like a great day for group bike repairs.&nbsp; I&#39;m not planning on stopping by until I can get there on my moped under its own power.&nbsp; Today, I&#39;m taking the family to the park.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for all the advice and guidance.&nbsp;

				I spent a little more time with the bike this afternoon.&nbsp; I carefully disassembled and cleaned my other spare Dellorto (another 12.10 I got complete on eBay a couple weeks ago).&nbsp; This &#39;other&#39; carb has some varnish on inside, but was otherwise in much better condition than the original bravo carb or the ciao carb I had already tried.&nbsp; <br /><br />After sealing the float bowl gasket and replacing the cruddy jet, I installed the whole thing with a refurbished air filter box and fired it up.&nbsp; <br /><br />She idled well.. She reved well.&nbsp; She drove well.&nbsp; She stopped well.&nbsp; I ran it around the empty lot next door.&nbsp; Ran it home, ran it down the long alley and back up.&nbsp; It did not miss a beat.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was getting some white smoke out the tailpipe.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s normal or not.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />This leaves me just a few wrinkles to iron out.&nbsp; <br /><br />1) my headlight does not seem to be getting power.&nbsp; I know the bulb works because I mistakenly hooked it to the run switch circuit.&nbsp; Maybe it is still hoked to the wrong thing.&nbsp; (The brake light does work when I apply either brake).&nbsp; <br /><br />2) My speedo seems to be at 2-5 mph starting.&nbsp; The speedo/odo unit seems to be moving around a bit inside the headlight housing.&nbsp; <br /><br />3) I&#39;ve not ridden a bike since high school and never in urban traffic.&nbsp; It makes me a little timid, but I&#39;ll get over it.&nbsp; <br /><br />4) my wife wife doesn&#39;t want me riding on the street without a helmet.&nbsp; (I can&#39;t do anything about that until Friday).&nbsp; Where&#39;s a good place to get a decent looking &quot;brain bucket?&quot;<br />&nbsp;

				Nice dude!<br /><br />Speedos lie anyway...dont need em!<br /><br />That timid traffic feeling goes away once you put a kit and a pipe on there for speed, not just top, but low end tourqe is what makes mopeds get around very well in trafffic...<br /><br />Im fighting my headlight situation my self... its goofy<br /><br />Glad you got it running...a very good feeling!!<br />COngrats

				Wow... I see why you guys are so nuts about the mopeds.&nbsp; Fired right up after work and buzzed my neighborhood for a while.&nbsp; Very enjoyable.&nbsp; It was grey, rainy and getting close to the home-rush, so I packed it in at 17:00.&nbsp; I would have run up to Murdoc Perk but they are closed on Mondays :(&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t want to go much further w/o a helmet.&nbsp; I was mainly testing to see if it would run okay for a longer period of driving.&nbsp; <br /><br />I may buzz it down towards the brewery this weekend to see if it&#39;ll get me to work without any grief.<br /><br />The power band is a little unpredictable and feels weak when climbing a hill.&nbsp; She was going about 25 mph or so on a downhill grade, maybe 15-20 up the same grade.&nbsp; It feels like I&#39;m missing some power somewhere - maybe it is the tiny stock exhaust pipe.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />My headlight started to work suddenly.&nbsp; It seems keyed directly to the rpms.&nbsp; Won&#39;t put out any light until it spins up for a while and starts to fade not long after I let it idle.&nbsp; Is that normal for a bike with no battery?&nbsp; The non-ignition wire from the engine looks worse for wear.&nbsp; I may need to drip some liquid rubber insulation in there to seal it.&nbsp; Otherwise, I&#39;ll have to remove the engine again... <br /><br />

				yeah, the stock exhaust will hold it back. there&#39;s usually a restrictor in there holding the engine back, plus the pipes have a small inside diameter. i&#39;m sure somebody on here knows where the restrictor is. a different pipe is your best bet. if you were at 25 it&#39;ll put you at 30 or a little more
