				well a few months ago a friend of mine asked if i wanted to live in his garage for 100 bux rent. i said hell yes! it kinda sucked tho because a hippy lived there and he took 3 months to move out so we ended up throwing all his shit out, i felt bad. so we had to rewire all the lights and outlets, power wash the whole inside, we are replacing the ceilings, we insulated most of it,&nbsp; still have to paint and build a wall. but other than that its coming along. im gonna be sleeping in the upstairs (haha) which is basically a crawlspace but a little bigger. its gonna be nice when we get done. another thing that sucks is a collect movies and i have like 1500+ VHS and they are gonna take up so much room we are gonna be covered in like roadwarrior VHS and bings.
