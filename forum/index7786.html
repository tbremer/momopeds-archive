				Well, the body is ok, needs a&nbsp; dome taillight that sits on top of the primary taillight and the headlight innards and lens.<br />The engine is a basket case, piston stuck to the inside, some bonehead put a new con rod on and used mix matched bolts here and there, makes me think perhaps the conrod was installed improperly, thus, the seize...gas tank is cracked up a bit .<br /><br />I was just thinking, should I rebuild it myself or send it to Brian? The main bearing (only one correct?) was spinning in its socket, I sprayed PB blaster, it broke loose the ball bearings , but I&#39;m thinking it needs replaced... <br /><br />My first Solex and I may be gutting it, I cant prove it, but I think Mark planned it all this way so he could see someone ELSE crack a case open...<br /><br />Basically a new head, piston, rings, bearing are in order, possibly a reinstall of the con-rod, it is all shiny, and the rest was rusty, that is why I figure it was recently replaced, and consequently caused the seize...<br /><br />Any thoughts, parts or sage advice is welcome... I&#39;m gonna refinish it to its former glory... its got the major componets there, just needs a total redo.

				I.Gym.Me, you just let me know how I can help you.<br />My best advice is to have all the proper Solex tools and be very patient if you are going to do it yourself. Ask questions first if you&#39;re not 100% sure of something. Put your hammer in the other room. Don&#39;t think of a Solex engine as being the same as other engines...somethings will seem odd and not make sense. Threads are very easily stripped, crankcases are easily cracked, etc. Don&#39;t use any gasket sealant anywhere. Take a look at the service manual on my website and see if it looks liek stuff you can do, and if you ahve all the tools shown:<br />http://velosolex4600.over-blog.com/pages/_Dealer_Training_Manual_October_1975_4600_V2_service_manual-1060111.html (http://velosolex4600.over-blog.com/pages/_Dealer_Training_Manual_October_1975_4600_V2_service_manual-1060111.html)<br />Replacing the crankcase bearing is not a task for the average mechanic. The bearing would not be changed in the old days...a whole new crankcase with the bearing, seal, crankshaft, etc. would be sold/used instead. You won&#39;t find instructions in any Solex manual for changing the bearing and/or for some other similar operations.<br />If the bearing was spinning in the bearing seat of the crankcase, the crankcase is shot.<br />The connecting rod definitely has to face a particular direction and I have come across several that have been installed backwards and done major damage.<br />The engine parts can be very expensive. I have very few, if any, good used parts, and I use mostly new parts when reconditioning an engine. <br />So you&#39;ll need to make some decisions as to what you are going to do, and I&#39;m here to help you however I can.<br />The headlight is extremely difficult to find and very expensive when you do. <br />Jeff at VeloCruz might have one of the top taillight lenses, also another very difficult item to find.<br /><br />Mark,<br />&nbsp;Thanks for posting the photo! Any videos? How about a photo with only 4600s in it for my website?

				OUCH...so if the bearing WAS spinning and no longer is, is it perhaps salvagable? If not do you have any bottom ends engines you might want to part with? It looks like its gonna be my winter project, prolly be patient and get the parts as I need them instead of trying to bulldoze it all at once -which is what I usually do, that is why Honda engines and I get along so well. <br /><br />I was hoping to be riding my Solex today in the epic ride, but, its not in the cards so, this is a double bummer! Oh well, the Solexi need some blockers Im sure...<br /><br />Thanks for the help! Im sure were gonna know eachother a little better by the end of this winter!<br /><br />Jimmy

				If the bearing itself is not tight in the crankcase, it generally means the seat is shot. Since there is only one bearing, it must be a nice, tight fit or else the play will get worse. But, you don&#39;t have much to lose, so you could always try it with a new bearing and see what happens. Jeff at VeloCruz might have some crankcases.<br />

				Well, Mark, that threaded socket puller ain&#39;t gonna do the job right &#39;cuz it&#39;s gonna rip the bearing out, with considerable damage to the crankcase.&nbsp; The bearing is staked in place by a rolled edge that has to be carefully rolled back to extract the bearing, then folded over to secure the new replacement bearing.<br /><br />Brian has devised his own tools to replace those bearings . . . he might teach you how to replace them, and how to craft the special tools needed to do the job, if you promise to help him gain possession of every model of Solex that he needs to complete his collection.&nbsp; <br /><br />It wouldn&#39;t hurt to practice up on your grovelling technique, too . . . just say over and over to yourself that you are across the desk from an IRS auditor and grovelling becomes the natural thing to do.<br /><br />Smiff

				the case ain&#39;t messed, my guess, just needs the magic re-stake,,,somehow, chisel the aluminium, around the bearing to hold it in place,,sorta like them thingies, where once its tight, you wire it shut, or take a puch and knock down a little collar in the nut,,, you know,, stake it , like to keep the tent from blowing into the warren.

				If we were speaking Latin, that would be fine, but as far as I can tell, we&#39;re all trying to speak English, and to make the plural of a word ending in X, one adds es.<br /><br />The engine suspension springs are one of the keys to Solex&#39;s success. They are just the right tension; not so strong that they pull the engine down on the tire and wear it away, and just strong enough to hold the engine down. And they are at just the right angle. Other companies that tried to make roller-drive bikes were not able to accomplish this. The front fender is necessary to hold the springs on top.<br /><br />(http://cyclo60.pagesperso-orange.fr/Monde/Indochine/Vietnam_091.jpg)

				I don&#39;t think so... the bobbling fender, imo, has&#39;nt enough strength to over ride the fix of the slides

				The sliders must be free, not fixed. It is <em>extremely important </em> that the engine pivot <em>freely</em> in the sliders. One must be very careful to not pinch the outer washer or the slider when tightening the shoulder nut. The shoulder nut must pass through the outer washer and the slider, and bottom on the inner washer. The sliders must regularly be cleaned and lubricated using fuel mixture and a brush, or with something like WD-40, never oil or grease. Again, the engine must pivot freely, and the sliders must not be fixed. Every piece of the Solex is well thought out, and even lowly pieces like the front fender and the brake caliper cover have purposes and are necessary. If it ever seems like a piece is not necessary on a Solex, you are most likely doing something incorrectly.&nbsp;

				the spring loaded fender<br />&nbsp; I think , that being a front wheel drive, in a hard road hazard (pot hole), the fender bobbles, pulls the springs on the slides, and tightens the grip on the tire.&nbsp; power thru rather than slip.
