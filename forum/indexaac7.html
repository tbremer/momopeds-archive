				I enjoyed the dip that Zac brought, as well as Johnny G&#39;s clementines. It&#39;s weird eating food in the shop though...<br /><br />Harbor Freight? Don&#39;t go there.<br /><br />The ride was rad. I&#39;m digging the fact that MidMO still hangs and rides on bitter bitter cold days. The worst is still to come. So, be asking for some winter weather riding gear from you loved ones this holiday season. <br /><br />Um.<br /><br />Sam, how&#39;s your project you&#39;ve been slaving over?<br /><br />

				yeah that shit is g0nna be a bitch to get out. I think the key to harbor freight is not to buy anything there that takes finesse to use...but i&#39;m probably wrong there too.

				I would have made it out if I wasn&#39;t slaving away on schoolwork yesterday.&nbsp; Plus the gf and I need a day to hang out and yesterday was the day.&nbsp; Got a christmas tree!!<br /><br />I&#39;ll be down for some cold riding either next weekend or the one after that.&nbsp; I may have some graduation party to attend to next sunday.&nbsp; &nbsp; Layers is the way to go.&nbsp; Long johns followed by fleece, followed by a windbreaking layer, followed by another jacket is some warm outfits.&nbsp; Thick socks and boots help too, as well as winter riding gloves.&nbsp; Reminds me, I need some winter gloves.

				Bass Pro had some winter weather gear on sale....flannel lined jeans for 20 bucks and such, I am not sure if it is a Holiday sale or what but it may be worth checking if you need some stuff.
