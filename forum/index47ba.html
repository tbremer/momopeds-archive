				<br />&quot;Mark your calendar now to visit the Kansas Short Grass Motorcycle Club&#39;s information booth next Sunday from 9 am to 5 pm during the first annual Vintage Motorcycle Show at the Douglas County Fairgrounds, Building #21. Our club will have a great display of t-shirts in a variety of safety florescent colors. Meet the members of the club and check out the fantastic display of items for sale including: oil cans, original sales brochures, flyers, race programs, repair manuals, dealer display items, Enthusiasts, vintage Easyriders and so much more. Also, we will have information available for any regional rider who would like to join our group August 7-14, 2010 on our First Annual Century Tour of Colorado in which we will be retracing the exact same route taken by our club 100 years ago in August, 1910. <br /><br />If this sounds like fun, please join us the coming Sunday and again on February 21st for our annual potluck supper and mid-winter meeting of the KSGMC at the Lawrence Public Library at 12:30 pm. Be sure to bring your own table service and a covered dish.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />alright just wait a fuckin minute here. is this a show, or a garage sale? <br /><br />and we have to pay $5 for this?&nbsp; <br />
