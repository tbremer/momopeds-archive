I&#39;ve been typing it out(one fingered) and running it through google translate. The wording/phrasing still needs to be worked over a little.&nbsp; Does anyone know of this already in good ol&#39; english?<br />This is what I got so far if anyone is interested and/or has any suggestions:<br /><br /><strong>Inflation engine: the Peugeot 102</strong><br /><br />It has virtually disappeared from the streets of major cities, the Peugeot 102 is still very widespread in rural areas and agglomerations(municipalities) province or mobeurs many do not hesitant to engage in regional races<br />So, to help the owners of this engine has to draw the quintessence we offer these few indications since no specific room n &#39;is marketed for this model.<br /><br />At work 1<br /><br />The work is simple, provided you have a few files of small size, or on a flexible electrical and strawberries.

Its particular form will require you to realize YOURSELF in the tube because there is nothing like this in the commerce. The carburetor is a Dell Orto, 15 SHA diameter, equipped with a nozzle 66.<br /><br />oh yea.. i got some small files and some strawberries.&nbsp; &nbsp;what the fuck do i do with the <em>strawberries??<br /></em><br />
