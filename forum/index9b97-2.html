				<br />Environmental Recycling Inc<br /><br />8000 Hall St<br />Saint Louis, MO<br /><br />Plastic Lumber Factory in North City, I lived about a block and a half away on Baden ave, in this fucked up apartment building peppered with real life gunfire. Me and my girlfriend at the time and the crack dealer across the hall were the only folks in the building that weren&#39;t devout crack-heads. My girlfriend was pretty crazy though, and had this idea in her head that I shouldn&#39;t be allowed to eat breakfast before I went to work at butt-fucking 6am, I think the idea was that I would lose weight, (which totally worked) but that was a pretty annoying start to the day. <br /><br />When I showed up for work I chatted with the guys, most of which were thirty years older than me, some more. Not that it matters, but to help build the scene of the story, I noticed that I was one of three white dudes who worked there (other than the owner, Foreman, and some asshole who didn&#39;t seem to do anything but dick around in the office with the owner) One of the white dudes was named Carl, he was very short, very mustache&#39;d and very pot-bellied. Carl always figured out a way to trick you into listening to his Viet-Nam stories, he loved to talk about Nam and it really annoyed me, I felt that he was way too&nbsp; excited to see another white dude working at the factory. Race seemed to be a factor in who Carl would talk to, it wasn&#39;t for me, I was a damned dirty post-crust punk who was just trying to wrest some interesting story out of life. But anyway, fuck Carl, he worked on the other side of the factory anyway. <br /><br />The other white dude was some asshole who always wore this fantastic &quot;Too Blessed To be Stressed&quot; sweatshirt, he always looked like he&#39;d done meth for too long/drank himself to sleep every night, they only brought him in when too many people called out sick (which was like twice when I worked there).<br /><br />The side of the factory I worked on housed the cutter/planer machine, I was the cutter half the time, other half I was the stacker. I was a terrible stacker, I fucked up alot, poor coordination, I was really slow at the task because I hated it, I hated putting myself in this menial position just to feel some bullshit &quot;real life&quot; experience. When I was the cutter I got to operate this really cool double blade saw, It had these really cheap plastic blade guards on it, and i got pretty good at just slamming my freshly cut plastic lumber into the side of the saw blade, fucking up the guard so that the Foreman would have to spend an hour fixing it while I took a standing nap or got high with the only other dude my age in some secret corner of the warehouse. <br /><br />My two favorite guys were Anthony (the guy that cut when i stacked and stacked when i cut), a very charismatic dude who I later found out was also deployed to Veit-Nam, I had to pry this information out of him, when I asked him what it was like all he said was &quot;It wasn&#39;t too nice, It wasn&#39;t too nice&quot;, Anthony had a shaved head and one gold front tooth, he was weary of me at first, that changed he saw me break the saw the first time, he really got to like me when I broke the factory implemented this &quot;no smoking on the floor&quot; rule. Anthony would let me drive the forklift sometimes, and I would abuse this privilage and race the damned thing around the floor, or drive to the other side of the factory, park it in the corner and get high.<br /><br />Some insanely old guy named Tom (I think, let&#39;s just call him Tom) operated the planer part of the machine, he was also in Veit-Nam, never talked about it. Tom had a face like a leather purse, and the body frame of someone who had just been rescued from Dachau. He also grew to like me once he saw the weird shit I would do to get out of working. <br /><br />This job was the worst I&#39;ve ever had, the sheer physical duress, never being able to get all the little bits of plastic shit out of my hair, that and almost every night I would have a dream that I was still at the factory, cutting and stacking plastic lumber. <br /><br />The best thing about the job was after Tom, Anthony and I all started getting along, It felt a little bit less like work, and alot more like three guys at the ends of their rope smoking cigarettes and breaking shit, and busting ass when we needed to.<br /><br />My last day there, it was a Friday, I told Tom and Anthony that I was going on a two week camping trip, then leaving the country, and I&#39;d probably never come back, they told me they&#39;d believe it when they saw it/see you Monday. <br /><br />I think about those dudes alot, I did leave the country, after a really weird-ass camping trip with my crazy girlfriend. I came back after dicking around Europe for a few months with her, but that&#39;s a shittier story.

				worked at a place in columbia making dashboards for mitsubishi&#39;s. i think the biggest issue i noticed was the only people that worked there that i could talk to and have a real conversation with were the engineers and the other temp/part time guy (part time.. yeah right, we worked more hours than the regular workers. for less pay.) <br /><br />the first job i had was &quot;applying gas permeable patches to the product surface prior to 2 part chemical application&quot; uh huh. yeah. I put medical tape over holes that let air out but not the foam chemical. and that didnt really work. I worked with a big guy that looked like santa claus but had about as much intelligent things to say as he had teeth (3 i think?) they pulled me from that after i would get waaay ahead of the guy. <br /><br />moved to assembly line where i put air ducts in the dashboards. boring. very boring and loooong days. the highlights of the day was when victor, this big russian immigrant guy, would force his parts on too hard and the dashboard would fall out of the jig as it got to my station. which would give everyone else a quick break as i put the goddamn thing back in the jig. <br /><br />break-times were standard (plant was union, i wasnt but got the same breaks). During these breaks, people actually thought i was &quot;one o them rain-mans&quot; because i didnt really talk much to them and could do their jobs faster than they could and learn new things pretty quick. that changed when one of them tried to pull off a joke that required me to be of the handicapped sort. short version: he tried to &quot;confuse&quot; me with questions about irrelevant things and i caused him to seem ridiculous. stupid shit. he was a fuckin idiot. <br /><br />got shifted around to other parts of the place and was actually offered full time as long as i joined the union. which is wasnt really into. the average daily production percent was like 40% if they were REALLY lucky. every other plant in the country was hitting 80 or higher. i saw more managers go through that place in 2 months than you might believe. it was pretty shitty, i saw a doomed place and knew it. <br /><br />one of the coolest dudes i met was after i moved to the &quot;hot side&quot; of the place. they actually formed the plastic inserts and rubber covers. average temp was around 110 or so, and we had mandatory water breaks etc. &quot;joe&quot; was a pretty cool guy. i worked with him when the other guy at the station adjacent got a pretty bad burn when he thought the rubber mold &quot;wasnt that hot&quot; and wanted a short cut. anyway, joe had some stories of being in korea and japan as well as central america &quot;and other places america didnt &#39;officially&#39; go&quot; he was a former special forces op dude and had lost a foot &quot;in one a them countries but i cant tell ya which&quot; actually he had served with another guy i knew from when i was pre-basic delayed entry for the army. <br /><br />we would get to chill for 20 minutes at a time after i found out how to get the machines timed together. was pretty nice. <br /><br />long story short: i quit the place after my lungs got fukd when they had me using a spray gun without any kind of protection. i got bronchitis REALLY bad and get it every year since. shit sucks. place closed down like, 3 weeks later.<br />

				worst job i ever had was building concrete form walls in a copper smelting plant out in warrenton. it was 100 outside and 140 in the hole that i was working in. it was dry heat though, but it sucked cause we were working right next to where they were melting the shit down and when they loaded the kettle, some of the shit splashed out and would land on us. <br />the best job was building a $100,000 tree house out by herman. it was a long drive, but man we were out in the woods with a huge pile of lumber. it was pretty neat. it was 2 full storys and about 35&#39; tall. it was off the ground 12&#39; and had a 25&#39; bridge over to it from the bank of the creek that it was based in.

				first job: old navy.&nbsp; It was alright.&nbsp; I never was on the register.&nbsp; I got to be overly nice and annoyingly helpful to people the manager thought were thieving.&nbsp; I got dressing room duty like 90% of the time, which was sweet for a 16 year old during swimsuit season.&nbsp; co-ed dressing rooms ftw<br /><br />best job: I had a bunch of odd jobs in NY that were pretty damn good.&nbsp; One I drove an 18 passenger van full of old people to the opera, they bought me lunch at a country club, and loved me.&nbsp; They probably would have been offended if they knew how hungover I was pretty often...<br />Another I was a way overpaid medical director of a day camp.&nbsp; Prettymuch did whatever I wanted and dished out ice packs and ritalin to kids.<br /><br />Worst job: &quot;compliance monitor&quot; = mind numbing, soul destroying, low pay office work with insane middle aged divorced/bitter women coworkers.&nbsp; That or subrogation.&nbsp; Which was another shitty office job at an auto insurance place.&nbsp; I got to call people to tell them they owed us money because an accident was their fault.&nbsp; Lots of swearing at me, etc.&nbsp; Once I got to call a guy to tell him that the dog our insured person ran over caused $1800 of damage to the car and that he owed us that money because there is a leash law and the dog wasn&#39;t on one.&nbsp; That really made me feel good about life.

				I was a Post Press Assistant at the Columbia Missourian. I didn&#39;t smoke rocks so I never quite fit in. Also I&#39;d never been to prison... so that was another strike against me. On breaks I&#39;d run across the street and slam beers at shakespeares. Every day I prayed for Death&#39;s sweet release. Then I got a girlfriend I liked. She convinced me to go back to college. A good move overall.<br /><br />My first job was at a TacoBell in 1989. I got like $3.25 an hour. My dad said I&#39;d learn valuable life lessons, and about the value of work and money. I learned that people are terrible and poverty sucks. I loved walking the 3 miles to work in my uniform down the street with no sidewalks. The plan was to work to get money to get a car to go to work in. Kinda silly really. But when I finally got that 1980 Ford Fairmont... well, I still never got laid...

				I actually really hated my job at MBS in Columbia after I graduated.&nbsp; I was surrounded by ladies and gents with multiple Master&#39;s Degrees.&nbsp; Some were near PhDs (ABD).&nbsp; Almost all of them just &quot;stopped&quot; trying for anything more, so they worked inventory control, or order processing for 6-7/hr and nearly no benefits.&nbsp; It took a serious emotional (and physical) toll.&nbsp; There&#39;s nothing quite like busting your ass in school only to come along side folks who went much further with their educations and ended up exactly where I stood.&nbsp; At least the conversations were good.&nbsp; <br /><br />Weirdly, it was a pretty job when I was a student.&nbsp; <br /><br />That place was the very essence of &quot;Lumbo&quot;&nbsp;

				@ holmes: i&#39;ve worked at IRI too hahaha that place blew nuts.. actually might be my worst job too. kinda pushed it out of my mind. called for the democrats when i worked there, and all i did was lie to people. nothing like getting written up for not getting a lady dying of aggressive cancer to donate $300. her last donation was over 1k but for serious: later on got a call back to her number and they said she had died from pancreatic cancer. felt like shit for a long time. probably wont ever forget her voice.

				Honestly, I&#39;m pretty reasonably satisfied with all my jobs:<br /><br />First: Short order fry cook - pretty fun, put asinine things in the fryer and rode around on keg rollers<br /><br />Snowboard instructor - got to watch chumps fall over, got to dick around after hours<br /><br />Pool cashier - got to, uh, see everything the lifeguards did, didn&#39;t have to sit in the sun.. hmm I might call them back<br /><br />Barista at a local coffee shop - buncha regulars to hang out with, free coffee for life<br /><br />IT (user and workstation) support/maintenance/installtion- my first big boy job, learned so so much and really set my career in motion.<br /><br /><br />Hopefully I&#39;ll get lucky with jobs from here on out, for everything else there&#39;s mopeds

				First job/worst job: Subway. There&#39;s a reason why, if you go to Taco Bell, or Wendy&#39;s, or McDonalds, or Burger King, or White Castle, or just about fast food establishment besides Subway, they have a person standing up front taking your order, and other people in the back making your food. It&#39;s because, if you were allowed to stand over the person making your food while it was being made, you&#39;d be stupid, picky, rude, and you&#39;d slow down what could otherwise be a much faster process. We pretty much can&#39;t get anything done without being interrupted by customers, which tends to make us resent customers. Of course, the customers themselves do a pretty good job making us hate them, just because nobody bothers to read or listen. Our menu design is awful and unintuitive, but we do get quite sick of being asked how much things cost; the menu is right behind me, and it&#39;s not SO terribly designed that you couldn&#39;t find an answer to your question if you spent 5 seconds reading. I also get sick of people not paying attention to their sandwiches -- like, &quot;Oh hey, yeah, you&#39;re trying to find out what vegetables I want on my sandwich, but you don&#39;t mind yelling halfway across the store at me, because I&#39;m super in a hurry and I NEED to fill up this drink cup RIGHT NOW.&quot; (Filling up a drink cup can be substituted with going to the bathroom, going out to your car, getting chips/apples, chasing your unruly child, sucking on your SO&#39;s face, joking around with your bros, gossiping with your sorority sisters, taking a phone call, texting ... ) Admittedly, I&#39;ve worked at Subway for entirely too long, so I&#39;m probably just bitter about it, but the whole thing really is a terrible design from the ground up. <br /><br />Best (only other) job: GIS/office work at the Kansas Biological Survey. Everyone I worked with was just absurdly nice, I got to work on some interesting projects, and I learned a lot/got a lot of good experience. I suppose some of the stuff was kind of tedious, but most of it appealed to my inner anal perfectionist, so even that stuff wasn&#39;t too bad.

				Dishwasher at Howard Johnson&#39;s in College Park, Maryland.&nbsp; 1963 &amp; pay was 56 cents an hour.&nbsp; Worked 8 hour evening shift . . . plus clean-up after the place closed was un-paid time.&nbsp; That was standard restaurant practice back then - if the doors were locked you were off the payroll.&nbsp; Also, minimum wage then was $1.25 an hour, but restaurants were exempt from the minimum wage rules.<br /><br />Oh, also, you paid for anything you ate . . . less a generous 20% off the menu price for an employee discount!<br /><br />Neat, huh?

				First and Worst job: Rouging wheat fields.&nbsp; I guess its a good excuse for giving 14 year olds sythes to walk up and down a wheat field and cut out anything that didnt belong in the seed crop.&nbsp; I believe they were exempt from child labor laws since it was agriculture in KS.&nbsp; So basically they would cart you around all over the state so you could walk up and down a field for 10 hours hacking out everything that didnt belong in the mud.<br /><br />In between: I worked on the carnival for a while.&nbsp; On a good day I would make more than I am making now, but any time it would rain out I would burn more in gas than profit.&nbsp; I have seen most every shit hole town west and east of the KC metro area.&nbsp; Some of these towns only had one bar and maybe a gas station to hang out with afterwards.&nbsp; I only mention it is because it has probably been the most influential observation of the human condition in my life.<br /><br />Somehow I have sold out, and the best job = whatever im being paid the most at.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				When i was dumber and younger I got busted for weed and had to get a second job to pay a lawyer. I ended up working in a screen print shop for a few weeks. Most of the day I was bent over huge tubs of turpentine scrubbing screens. I got a terrible acid burn all over my stomach from the shit after my first day. They showed me the industrial apron the next day. I guess since I put up with it for a week I was golden boy, so they promoted me to screen reclaimer where I got to work with heavy quantities of the grossest chemicals I&#39;ve ever encountered. Makes carb cleaner in the eye feel like a blowjob compared to accidentally inhaling the stuff i hosed the screens down in all day. I quit on the spot one day when my boss said something stupid to me. <br /><br />Shakespeare&#39;s was supercool cause I got to drive around and get high and deliver pizzas and listen to jams all night. Then i found out that you could just work inhouse and be high, listen to jams all night, AND get drunk cause you didn&#39;t have to drive! Then I got to be a manager and got to punish bad employees with huge shots of 151 and tabasco! And they still give me to hookup. <br /><br />35mm projectionist was cool too. Simplex fo life! Holla if ya hear me!<br /><br />

				Linda,<br />You should come to the dark side and work for the feds here in St. Louis... assuming the dumbarses in Congress don&#39;t shut us down permanently.&nbsp; I&#39;d be nice to see another moped in the parking lot.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mad GIS skills will get you something local.

				Eh, tedious doesn&#39;t bother me. I figure that if I ever get a real GIS-related job, I&#39;ll have to put in a good 5 years of mind-numbing digitizing and data entry stuff before I get to the more advanced stuff (although really, it&#39;ll be a good 5 years of experience and extra training before I understand the more advanced stuff). It&#39;s just that everyone wants you to know CAD and database stuff, or sometimes servers and programming. KU didn&#39;t teach us any of that, and the only thing everyone else wants is experience, and you have to be hired to get experience. It&#39;s good to know you can still get a job with only a minor in geography, though. That makes me slightly more hopeful.

				I think the worst job I did was a combo-worked at a school as a special ed TA from 8am-3:15, came home ate dinner-slept briefly-whent to school in the evening 5-8pm ish-came home changed clothes-worked at UPS from 9pm-4-5am.&nbsp; This process repeated itself 5 days a week, I cut out all unnesscary functions like bathing, Sooooo tired every day.&nbsp; Got up Saturday mornings at 10am to see the family, normal day on sunday, then back to the crazy all over again.<br /><br />Best job-teaching has been good, being off all summer is wonderful.&nbsp; So I still got paychecks while I vacation up in the NW, so that was a good job.<br /><br />

				At a food production worker job I once had, there was a gi-normous storage tank 20&#39;x40&#39; of chocolate that accidentally had water pumped into it. As the chocolate hardened into a solid mass, the mixer blade belts squalled like banshees, then burned off the pulleys. The access hatch was pushed in with a fork lift and we tunneled out a gooey chocolate cave using paint scrapers and 5 gallon buckets passed from worker to worker for two days of rotating shifts until it was empty.

				No actually, once something touched the floor or the feet, it becomes unclean. When I first started they allowed the workers to taste the product. Most would lose their head, chow down, and get sick, never wanting to do it again. I paced myself and was picky, chocolate covered almonds, nut clusters, raisin nuts, peanut brittle, and macadamia nut brittle, latte white chocolate coated coffee beans, all good stuff. After five years they changed the rules and you weren&#39;t supposed to sample any more.

				This thread has been awesome.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had lots of crappy jobs but they all had their good points.&nbsp; Let&#39;s see:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Detassled and walked beans in Iowa.&nbsp; Yes, we pulled the tassle off of every stalk of corn in a row for seed companies.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cleaned dorm rooms in the summer after students moved out.&nbsp; Always cool stuff in the back of drawers.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Worked at IBP Iowa Beef Processors one summer.&nbsp; We butchered hogs and processed the meat.&nbsp; I still will never forget the tour where the guy kills the pigs.&nbsp; They are stunned, hung upside down and he sticks a knife in their throats.&nbsp; He is covered in blood and walking around in it all day long.&nbsp; Makes you think about eating meat.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Worked for a moving company one summer. That was hard work made even harder by working with druggies.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Resident Assistant in college.&nbsp; Paid the bills.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Security on campus.&nbsp; I went through and locked all of the buildings on campus from 10pm to 2am.&nbsp; Creepy going through campus buildings at night.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Teaching middle school is the best job ever though.&nbsp; You laugh at least 20 times a day.<br /><br /><br /><br />
