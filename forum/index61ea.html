				.. with the internal ignition coil and 12v lights. Has anyone else run this? I just go mine put on the other day, and the lights are all kinds of bright.. But it&#39;s been a pain getting the thing advanced enough to run well. I think it&#39;s supposed to be paired with the new $25 treats flywheel, which is &quot;super advanced, not like your stock one&quot;. I say this because I had to Dremel the nuts out of the adjustment holes to get the thing advanced to stock timing settings, even.<br /><br />But like I said, I could wake the dead with my lights, and I&#39;ve got an atomic bomb of a spark. Woo!

				I got 2..one went to mali mikes bike. It seems like it works great on my bike, and his bike was only a little harder b/c of the timing adjustment. It is a little difficult to advance it, but I seem to have it working just fine without buying the aftermarket stator. Best thing is that it has 3 wires...how can you fuck that up right?

				justin, you&#39;re going to need a timing light and you&#39;ll need to mess with your points to get it advanced enough.

				Yeah, I messed with the points a bunch, and dremeled out the adjustment holes.. It&#39;s firing like 2mm or so btdc (that&#39;s about right, isn&#39;t it?), but it runs all goofy like. Why?

				Oh, hell. Looking at the conversion chart<br />//www.mopedarmy.com/wiki/Ignition_Timing_Chart_for_Puch (//www.mopedarmy.com/wiki/Ignition_Timing_Chart_for_Puch)<br /><br />I guess I&#39;m CRAZY advanced, compared to stock. I might retard things a bit and see if that helps.<br /><br />Where do you blasters run your timing, anyhow? My cylinder revs out to a bit over 11k, as verified by the gearing spreadsheet. So that means I should have a pretty aggressive advance, yeah?

				I run a stock cylinder maxi with the treats stator, it has a homoet 4p pipe and a 15mm carb/intake..I got it set to 1.8mm. I dont think you really need to be any more advanced than 2mm. But it should run fine on 2mm as well. Adjust that points gap and see what that does at 1.8mm

				Those Gazelles are huge, though. I think the IRC Zaps are fairly tall compared to a stock tire, but it can&#39;t be by much. <br /><br />I just need to suck it up and get a tiny tach.

				Okay well you go out and measure how many inches your tire travels in one rotation. I think they have like 69.123213210983u1208 inches in the sheet.<br /><br />When you are done report back here.<br /><br />Also please try at different tire pressures and take detailed notes :P<br /><br />It is really easy to edit that sheet and add other gearings and 14&#39;&#39; tires and stuff. Like Mike&#39;s gila dart with 9x56 gearing and 14&quot; tires dream.

				I got a giant tach, it works twice as well as a small one.<br /><br />A tiny difference in the overall tire outer diameter when the wheel is revolving at who knows how many rotations per minute...it can add up quickly. Trust me, people have cars that have to get their speedos adjusted for the 5-10mph difference when they change tires. That is why if you are a mathmatician you can go to court and try and get out of a ticket...not saying you will but I&#39;m saying you could do it...
