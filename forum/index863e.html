				If its going to be nice on Sunday I might try and ride from Kansas City to Lawrence for moped Sunday.&nbsp; &nbsp;Its something I have been wanting to do forever, but haven&#39;t tried yet.&nbsp; I know Kenden did it a while back, major props.&nbsp; I was wondering how the hell I get from city to city without taking I-70 or K-10.&nbsp;

				We did a couple of rides from my place in Western Shawnee to Lawrence.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had some people express interest in doing it again but just haven&#39;t had the time.&nbsp; On one route we went north of the river from Bonner and there were some neat roads.&nbsp; We crossed the river at Eudora and headed west.&nbsp; Another, shorter way, was to take 87th street in to DeSoto, cross under K10, head west, then cut up in to Eudora and you can back road it from there.&nbsp;

				If I make you a route on google maps, can you just access that from your phone? Although really, I do kind of agree with Daryl on this one. If you break down though, call me and I&#39;ll come get you.

				Okay, I&#39;ve got a route on Google Maps. I&#39;m not particularly familiar with a lot of the areas around KC, so if I should change it to avoid certain roads, let me know. <br /><br />Link:<br />//www.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=39.104222,-94.64344&amp;spn=0.147862,0.308647&amp;z=12&amp;msid=214148683783342125912.0004a5688eed2fa1e6d96 (//www.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=39.104222,-94.64344&amp;spn=0.147862,0.308647&amp;z=12&amp;msid=214148683783342125912.0004a5688eed2fa1e6d96)<br /><br />Basically, I have you starting at Summit &amp; SW Blvd<br />Take SW Blvd south/west across Mission Rd. It turns into Merriam Lane.<br />Take Merriam Lane south/west until you reach Antioch. Go south on Antioch for a long time.<br />Turn east onto Santa Fe Drive/87th St.<br />Take 87th west for a long time. This turns into 83rd, which will eventually take you into DeSoto.<br />83rd turns into Lexington Ave, which cuts through DeSoto and heads south across K10. On the southern side of K10, Lexington Ave turns west and becomes 103rd St/N1400 Road. <br />N 1400 Road will take you under K10 again and into Eudora. After that, it&#39;s pretty much a straight shot into Lawrence, or at least by the time you have to turn, I figure you&#39;ll know where you are already. <br /><br />That&#39;s as close as I could get to Bryan&#39;s directions, plus adding in getting from Brett&#39;s part of KC to the part where Bryan&#39;s directions start. Again, if any of those are roads you shouldn&#39;t be using a moped on, I can change them around. And Brett, if you&#39;re planning on using your phone GPS, then google maps is probably your best bet. (Your phone can navigate from google maps, can&#39;t it?) If you can borrow a Garmin unit, I can turn this into a Garmin file that you can upload to SOME models, but I haven&#39;t been able to test that well with my own GPS, much less with whatever you get ahold of.

				Thank you Nancy and Linda.&nbsp; I also don&#39;t think its the smartest idea, but whatever.&nbsp; I&#39;m working on the Grand Prix today to try and get the kinks out since it has been sitting for several months.&nbsp; I thought a ride to lawrence would be a nice way to prove that it is rally ready.&nbsp; If not I have other peds on stand by and Tom will just be really pissed at me. <br /><br />

				If you really wanna do it, go for it. Just make sure you wear all your gear, real shoes, gloves, etc. Also, if you have a mirror you can put on there, do that. And again, if you break down, just call me.

				You might just want to trailer it. I think I lost my phone, so if you break down and need to call someone, I won&#39;t pick up if you call me unless I find my phone somewhere.
