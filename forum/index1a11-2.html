You like it? Is it a &quot;ask Sandy!&quot; or is this a &quot;Sandy Claws will bit your dick off for asking for stupid shit.&quot; question?<br /><br />Should i buy?

				so mike you wanted to know why we don&#39;t help people anymore.....well guess you got your answer. Matt had a defective CDI which was backed up by Benji.&nbsp; You asked him what he thought so he told you...and 12MM Bings do suck...wait thats my opinion I am sure I&#39;ll get crucified for having an opinion...So I guess you win the internet!!&nbsp; Bashing Matt when he doesn&#39;t have account to post anymore....wow!!&nbsp; Don&#39;t bother responding I only look at a few websites when I have a chance...:) <br />P.S <br />HI EVERYONE.....MISS you guys!!&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index3960.html?topic=5854.msg65110#msg65110">Quote from: mikebeez BLKBLK on November 18, 2010, 10:39:31 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">matt told me bings were the worst carbs ever and that CDI&#39;s would blow up my bike. i seem to love bings and cdis now. what the FRICK<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

				lol we rode kc last night! and we saw matt driving the van around. And my opinion is that CDI&#39;s and bings are good, its all opinions baby. not bashing matt just pointing out that when you know nothing about mopeds, opinions are misleading when they are so strong. holler at us sometime! dude!
