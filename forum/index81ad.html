				yeah, i dont think the charging system works completely. not really sure whats up with it, but all the lights work perfectly. i&#39;m guessing if you replaced the battery with a voltage regulator it would just work forever instead. if i end up keeping it i&#39;ll probably do that anyway, i hate batteries.<br /><br />im pretty sure this model had electric start too, which doesnt work. i just bump-start it.<br /><br />definitely a project, but a cool bike and pretty rare too. kawasaki&#39;s dealer network in america was pretty much non-existent in 1966.<br /><br />good brakes, carb, completely rideable as-is, but i&#39;d put the new tires on first if i were you.

				whatever happens, i want the fate of this bike to be one of two things:<br /><br />A. completely beautifully restored to original spec, showroom new bike<br /><br />B. forget about it cosmetically but push the power from the stock 18hp to like, 35hp.

				Just added pics of one set of wheels, the other forks, and the swingarm.&nbsp; Also handlebars, one grip, and the OG brake stuff.&nbsp; The original brake master cylinder doesn&#39;t pump right.&nbsp; Might be able to take it apart and fix it, but I&#39;ve got another one from a scooter laying there (untested).&nbsp; This was monsterped.&nbsp; It was never built.&nbsp; Once I mocked it up, I realized it is a bad idea.&nbsp; Sooooo heavy.<br /><br />The complete motor is there, but it is now missing the carb, intake, and reeds (traded them before).<br /><br />Pics yet to come:<br />Other wheels are the same, lil rattier, original tires on both sets but they seem alright.&nbsp; Frame has fresh black paint.&nbsp; Rear shocks are rusty.&nbsp; Freshly painted pipe...&nbsp; have to dig in basement to see if there&#39;s anything else.&nbsp; Oh, there&#39;s a super ratty seat too.

				rad. my bike actually came with 2 extra master cylinders so that might not be a problem. i&#39;ll check out the pics now. the more and more i think about this the more stoked i get. i was scared to hack up my pipe (to weld up a chamber...cheeeaper than a homoet!) and case match my engine since i only have one (in case i wanna go back to stock someday), but with extra shit its no problem at all.

				Do you still have the F2 175 for sale?&nbsp; I picked up one of these bikes last spring and it&#39;s awesome.&nbsp; My brother loves the bike also so I&#39;m looking for one for him for a birthday gift.
