				My son in New Mexico keeps up with local (St. Louis) news and sent this link to me:<br /><br />//westcountyjournal.stltoday.com/articles/2008/07/25/news/doc4888edad6a7de717748035.txt<br /><br />What a conundrum!&nbsp; Unlicensed vehicles are prohibited in Chesterfield and the state won&#39;t license a vehicle under 50cc.&nbsp; In fact, wasn&#39;t PopCycle selling machines there??<br /><br />I seem to remember some former PopCycle employees riding to Chesterfield once.&nbsp; I wonder if they knew it was/is illegal to ride any vehicle that is less than 50cc in Chesterfield.&nbsp; We will need to scratch that location from our Sunday night ride possibilities.<br /><br />Maybe we should do more research to see what other cities around St. Louis have enacted such laws.<br /><br />Dave

				The law will be overturned upon judicial challenge.&nbsp; You can&#39;t ban vehicles from the road that have been DOT approved for road use.&nbsp; That&#39;s just discrimination.<br /><br />Most places that passed the &quot;nothing under 50cc&quot; laws did it in response to those pocket bikes that were popular a few years ago.&nbsp; People rode those around, and the police had no ordinance (that they knew of) that they could ticket them for.&nbsp; Well, they could have impounded their pocket bikes, or given tickets, because they were riding non-DOT approved vehicles.&nbsp; Unfortunately local police, and local politicians aren&#39;t very intelligent.&nbsp; They passed these stupidly restrictive laws to get rid of them, and effectively got rid of legitimate, DOT-approved ways for licensed drivers to get around.<br /><br />If they keep this law in effect, we should swarm Chesterfield.&nbsp; Yes, PopCycles were sold there, and I&#39;ve personally driven a number of 49cc and 50cc vehicles on Chesterfield roads with no problems, nor any feeling of being unsafe doing so.<br /><br />Interestingly, our mopeds are a true 50cc (well, some of them - I&#39;m 99% sure Puchs are).&nbsp; So the state won&#39;t license 50cc or under, and Chesterfield prohibits anything under 50cc.&nbsp; But we&#39;re just at that cutoff where we&#39;re exempt by state law, and Chesterfield can&#39;t touch us.&nbsp; To be sure of this I&#39;d need to see an actual copy of the Chesterfield ordinance, but that is my impression of it from the article.

				The problem is Chesterfield. Too many stuck up snobs driving SUV&#39;s. The soccer moms must have been pissed after being sued by so many injured moped riders. Politics really makes me want to go Duke Nukem.

				were one to take the serial number from his moped, go down town, and register it as a bicycle. albeit incorrect, there&#39;d be a name, and number piece of paper.... then to ride our mopeds out to this guys court date, fail to comply, and force arrests, and impounds... maybe we could make a 1st amendment stink, and at least I&#39;d have more room here.

				How much does it cost to register a bicycle?<br /><br />Someone needs to challenge this law.&nbsp; Unforunately not many moped/scooter people are going to have the requirements:<br />1 - The desire to change the law via a legal battle.<br />2 - The money to do so.<br />3 - The time to do so.

				Well you could buy a 49cc puch and kit it. Then it would be over 50cc&#39;s and you could once again ride it on the roads in Chesterf*cked.

				Right, but then you have to pay to register, plate, and insure it...which kinda defeats the purpose of a moped.&nbsp; At least in my book.
